				<li>Voshchev: Voshchev is in the 30th year of his "lichnoi zhizni" (~48). At the start of the novella, he is fired from the machine facotry because he does not keep up with the pace of production, owing to his excessive introspection ("zadumchivost'"). He believes that his body has grown weak because he does not know truth: "У меня без истины тело слабнет, я трудом кормиться не могу...". He arrives at the foundation pit and initially believes that the workers there know all and have truth inside them, which makes them capable of work. He wants to recover the meaning of life and live: "Пока я был бессознательным, я жил ручным трудом, а уж потом - не увидел значенья жизни и ослаб". Voshchev begins to get disillusioned with the foundation pit: "Говорили, что всё на свете знаете...а сами только землю роете и спите!...всё равно мне без истины стыдно жить" (198). </li>
				<li>Zhachev: A man without legs, whom Voshchev encounters on his way to the foundation pit. Voshchev chastises Zhachev for his attentions to the young girls. Zhachev does not work but receives a pension; he harrasses Pashkin for more money and food, knowing that (because of a past court investigation) Pashkin and his wife Olia will give in. Zhachev rips roses up from the ground; he believes that he is better "po chelovechestvu" than Pashkin. He is cut in half by capitalism (war): "меня капитал пополам сократил".</li>
