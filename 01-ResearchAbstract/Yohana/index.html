<body>Broadly, the paper situates its analysis within the space where borderlands, law, language, and labor intersect. It begins by tracing the history of 19th century labor production in Kashmir, specifically looking at the production of woven silks (kashmir) and its workers (shawlbafs) before investigating how the particular sites of production have transformed in the wake of post-British-colonial Indian occupation. The paper seeks to identify archival gaps in the histories of Kashmir as a liminal borderland between nation-states, colonial and postcolonial rule, and ongoing ethno-religious and ethno-nationalist violence. How do the violences of settler ideology and the subsequent labor of resistance become coded within the land, in Kashmiri tools, labor practices, poetry and language of the law? Most scholarship on Kashmir focuses on its political struggles post-Independence, which gave way to the formation of modern-day Pakistan and India, the rise to power of Hindu ethnonationalism in India, and the subsequent occupation of Kashmir. In examining these earlier histories and sites, traces of labor and subjugation emerge from the intersecting landscapes of language, law, and land, and the resulting knowledge parallels the scholarship on labor production of 18th and 19th century Europe together with British colonial violence and South Asian and Arab state politics, ultimately enabling a deeper understanding of the entangled violences occuring in occupied Kashmir. </body>
