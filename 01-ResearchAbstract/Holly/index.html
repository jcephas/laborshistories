While the history and legacy of the <i>Gastarbeiterprogramm</i> in the former Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) is well documented, similar programs in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) have been the subject of significantly less research, and the implications of foreign labor on East Germany’s architecture and construction industries remains largely unexplored. In the late 1970s and 1980s a series of initiatives and bilateral agreements between East Germany and Mozambique brought over 25,000 individuals from the newly independent African nation into the GDR for vocational training and work in factories, on farms, in mining, and in construction. Drawing on recent scholarship as well as my own research into the changing nature of architectural education and practice in the GDR’s final 15 years, my research project will focus on the experiences of Mozambican <i>Vertragsarbeiter</i> (“contract workers,” the GDR’s term for foreign laborers) in order to better understand how a new workforce contributed to changes in conceptions of the built environment on a variety of scales. At the center of my project is an interest in making these experiences of labor, as well as the exploitative East German policies which made them possible, visible and legible to a wide audience: often considered temporary or inconsequential to the GDR’s economic or cultural history, <i>Vertragsarbeiter</i> had personal and unique experiences of state socialism, and occupied literal spaces in East German communities. At present, I anticipate some sort of interactive mapping project, with a written component expanding upon the relationship between Mozambican <i>Vertragsarbeiter</i> and the architecture and construction sector.
