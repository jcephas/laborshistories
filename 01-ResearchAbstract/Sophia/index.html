		<p>The term “surveillance” has increasingly found its way into the zeitgeist as questions of privacy plague users of emerging technologies. While security apparatus can be found in most places, whether public or private, and across personal devices such as cellphones and laptops, surveillance mechanisms as they exist in the built environment disproportionately impact those with marginalized identities. This project seeks to build on prior research I had conducted that analyzed the effects of university campus surveillance mechanisms on Black and Brown students through the kens of architectural analysis and affect theory. Placing architectural history and analysis in conversation with anthropological and sociological research from scholars such as Setha Lowe and Simone Browne, I look to further analyze the ways in which quotidian or “everyday" spatial and/or architectural, surveillance conditions influence the creation of Black racial subjects. Through the (anticipated) use of mapping tools and other visualization methods, the “backend” goal is to explore other ways of representing this information and creating a platform that makes these findings, histories, and stories more tangible and accessible beyond that of the “academic paper.”
