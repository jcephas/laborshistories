  	This interactive, screen-based, environment is an archive of the intermingled identities of worker, laborer, property, and individual in lieu of the subjectivity of the enslaved Black "African" Woman. 
	In converation with theories of work and labor by Karl Marx by Hannah Arendt, it is my intention to identify biologically female woman as double laborers by nature, possessing bodies that have the ability to physically re-produce a commoditized labor and laborer, inso that the womans naturality has now become part of this profitable system of extraction. By way of this theory, one may recognize that when this type of body is incorporated into capitalism, how ones identity is certain to be lost or stolen through the subjigation of someone into something.Because the Black slave woman does not belong to herself by any means, there is tension between her subjective positions; how she is interpellated,illustrated, described,or percieved... and then how she  maintains her own sense of self. Because the product of Black intimacy is of value, and the Black Womans body is the machine necessary for the production of human capital, this work sets out to uncover how we might we define the agency of the Black woman's body as laborer vs. worker.

<h4 style="text-indent: 50px;">
This body of work is  a close reading of images and accounts that provide subjective, objective, and personal perspectives on the work and experience of the Black woman worker-laborer. Texts such as; A Woman Rice Planter by Elizabeth W. Allston Pringle and Alice R. Huger Smith (1913), Kimberly Cleveland’s Black Women Slaves Who Nourished a Nation: Artistic Renderings of Black Wet Nurses of Brazil, and Eddie Donoghue’s Black Women/white Men: The Sexual Exploitation of Female Slaves In the Danish West Indies provide contextual relationships through various roles of the capitalized Black Woman body to assist in studying the layered identity of these enslaved women as subject, worker, laborer, and self. Furthermore, the richness in content of these pre-emancipation texts and recollections  may result in an uncovering and discovering of the various methods by which the Black Woman’s body has become the central sustainer of American infrastructure, and how the documentation of the labor/work production by Black bodies contintues to subvert the Black Woman’s body into a state of subjectivity.
