		<div id="bodytext">
			<p>Six years after overseeing the design and construction of Central Park in New York, Frederick Law Olmsted was appointed “Superintendent or Manager” of the Mariposa Estate, a network of gold mines occupying a ten square mile land grant in central California.<a href="#Reference1"><sup>1</sup></a> Famous for inventing the modern profession of landscape architecture and for his abolitionist writings on the agricultural economies of the American South published in major newspapers in the years immediately before the Civil War, Olmsted is less known for his work in mineral extraction.<a href="#Reference2"><sup>2</sup></a>  The New York businessmen controlling the Mariposa Company selected Olmsted to run the mines’ day-to-day operations because of his proven administrative competencies, familiarity with the political economy of land-based industries, and landscape architecture’s clear applicability to mining.<a href="#Reference3"><sup>3</sup></a>  This mid-19th century confusion between landscape architecture and mining, I argue, underscores the historical intimacy between land, labor, and value.<a href="#Reference4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
			<p>When Olmsted arrived at Mariposa Estate, he soon decided that the mine workers’ wages were too high, so he slashed pay and began hiring Chinese laborers at $1.75 per day, about a dollar less than white workers were paid. Miners then organized a strike, which Olmsted eventually terminated by sending sheriffs after the action’s organizers.<a href="#Reference5"><sup>5</sup></a>  Olmsted remained in charge of Mariposa Estate between 1863 and 1865, during which time he ingratiated himself with the leaders of San Francisco businesses like banks, shippers, telegraph companies, canal building firms, and oil prospectors – the kinds of firms that would soon profit from settler expansionism.<a href="#Reference6"><sup>6</sup></a>  Olmsted himself invested in these firms while also managing other New York elites’ investments in California infrastructure.<a href="#Reference7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

			<p class="section">Proposal</p>
		</div>

		<div id="bodytext">
			<p>This project has two main components: First, drawing on published correspondences, period newspapers, and accessible archival material, this project will geographically map the flows of money through Olmsted and the Mariposa Company to visualize the spatiality of settler financial institutions. Second, this project will feature a graphic narrative of Olmsted’s work as a mining manager, investor, and landscape architect at Mariposa Estate, including as much information as available about the lives of the miners working for Olmsted. Both the map and timeline will cover the period between 1863 and 1865.</p>
