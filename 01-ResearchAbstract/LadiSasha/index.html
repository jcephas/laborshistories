		<h1>Black Spatial Play</h1>
		<h4>Arc 550 _ Space And Subjectivity: Laborâ€™s Histories</h4>
		<h4>Research Abstract</h4>
		
		<p>This project explores constructions of Black spatial practice around play and performance across the southern United States. Identifying and surveying sites for card clubs and theater houses that were active post-Civil War and into the early twentieth century, with the aim shifting the historiography of these structures as illustrations of Black formalism. The screen-based environment will present a mapping of these self-built through investigating archival records, early print materials and periodicals, and state and city land records. Addressing questions around cultural production and architectural strategies. What can these spatial geographies signify around the sociality of Black spatial thought and practice? What social and political conditions shaped these Black building practices, from materiality to environmental circumstances like  building underground and building through temporal fragility? What of the emergent aesthetics that permeate Black spacemaking and placekeeping? This research hopes to glean what is being produced in the pursuit of designing toward Black play?</p>
