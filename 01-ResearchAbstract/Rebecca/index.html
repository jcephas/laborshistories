	<h2>Research Abstract</h2>
	<p>This data visualization project will serve as a key component of the fifth chapter of my dissertation that focuses on “peopling” as an “infrastructural technique”. The chapter will rely on a close examination of the movement and settlement of people in response to the U.S.-constructed Panama Canal project (1904-1914). Specifically, this data-driven project will rely on a constructed dataset that will be developed through the cataloging of digitized “Photo-metal applications “ that are part of a larger digitized archive of Panama Canal Zone employment records available on FamilySearch. While there appears to be well over 15,000 items to catalog, this project will aim to catalog at least 100 individual employment cards in order to glean a sample of patterns and/or anomalies within the dataset. This project will aim to understand more intimate details about the laborers on the canal project and attempt to identify the kinds of laboring subjects these cards produce. It will also seek to address larger questions about labor management practices at this time and in this context.
