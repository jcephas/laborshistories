				The superimposition of Spanish and American colonial structures in Puerto Rico has created precarious living conditions that define unique relationships between labor, production, and capital. The continuous existence of Puerto Ricans in the wake of disaster reflects bodily negotiations that must occur in order for life sustaining work to be accomplished. In response to this condition the term la brega has emerged as an encompassing word that allows Puerto Ricans to express a response to the many invisible structures that subjugate daily life. The term la brega has been analyzed by Professor Arcadio Diaz Quinones, who has argued that la brega: “No es una forma de ser. Es una forma de estar y no estar, un tipo no preciso de lucha, una negociación entre la ausencia y la presencia”.  The cyclical nature of la bregadera, blurs the boundaries between labor and regeneration as energy is constantly being exerted since mitigation never fully resolves the totalizing effects of systemic colonial power structures.  For my research project, I am interested in investigating how forms of architectural labor –produced in la brega / bregando– have or have not been represented, given its blurry relationship with labor and association with lower status work.
