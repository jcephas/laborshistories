				The Meaning of Language and Labour in Platonov's 'Kotlovan' (1930)
			</h3>
		</div>

				In my final project, I will interrogate the ways in which symbolic and ideological questions of labour are worked into the semantic layer of text in Andrei Platonov’s novella Kotlovan (‘The Foundation Pit’, 1930). In Kotlovan, a group of men are set to work digging an enormous pit upon which, they are told, a house for the proletariat will be built. As time drags by and the work remains unfinished, the workers gradually realise that they are, in fact, digging their own graves. Throughout the novella, descriptions of the body are figured through the physical exertion of labour and the metaphysical weakening caused by a loss of truth and thought. This duality of the body contributes to a philosophical engagement with labour through which the Marxist theorisations of labour underlying the Stalinist period are ironically dialogised and yet not totally undermined. Set within and about the materialist ideologies of early-stage collectivisation in Soviet Russia, Kotlovan explores the attempts to dig the pit as a failed metabolism with nature through which the workers come to fail themselves: ultimately, what is produced through their efforts does not ‘add value’ but rather saps the life from the workers as they destroy the natural environment. In the most basic sense, Platonov seems to be suggesting that collectivisation works insofar as it precipitates a collective loss of metaphysical meaning and physical death. Kotlovan was heralded by Iosif Brodskii as the first surrealist novel. Brodskii argues that, through his curation of grammar and semantics, Platonov succeeds in voiding language of meaning. What interests me is how Platonov’s semantic ‘dead-end’ parallels the literal ‘dead-end’ the workers face at the bottom of the pit: where do labour and meaning start to fall apart?</p>
