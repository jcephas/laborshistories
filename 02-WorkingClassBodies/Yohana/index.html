            Where marks the edge condition between the body as abstraction and bodies as material entities? How does this dichotomy serve to reproduce its effect? Within the arguments of each author resides a crucial understanding of the manner in which language and written scholarship serve to represent and socially reproduce the working body. For Mauss, the addressed “you” and “we” are interchangeable; fellow French intellectuals of the early twentieth century whom I would assume inhabit certain intellectual positions on the body that perpetuate what we know today to be pseudoscientific. He certainly teeters on the edge of reifying those positions that he seems to ultimately reject, notions of primitivism and such (wasn’t the practice of intentional cranial deformation through cradling millenia old by that point?). Nonetheless, it seems important that he works through this logic, example after example, if only to convince his peers of his argument on the biological-sociological-psychological interplay that constitutes the body.

            Kuskey’s emphasis on the law becomes an important thread that relates the interplay of abstract body to corporeal body. Where the language of the law serves to dematerialize the body, it rematerializes as evidence in court. This practice of body as evidence increases in exigence if we consider how notions of citizenship shape the laboring body alongside class, race, gender, and disability. Historically, one might consider the Atlantic slave trade as the first globalized migration, where the laboring body of the slave is abstracted and dehumanized into chattel (remember Zong). We see this act of border-crossing, migration, exile, and its implications on how a body’s labor is measured in contemporary migrant labor. Undocumented status produces a different laboring body, and these ambiguous notions of citizenship make it impossible to easily articulate one’s grievance. The law once again plays its part in enforcing the harm of bodily abstraction.

            These three articles (Mauss, Kuskey, and Baron and Boris) write on the material body as a first line of resistance in countering its abstraction, yet I wonder what other methods of resistance might exist to counter bodily abstraction, or why the corporeal seems to be the focused site. Each of these authors tackle the issue of law, a practice obsessed with language, and it begs me to question if we might directly address the abstraction as the site of resistance, rather than the material consequence it produces. Certainly for (and to end with) Slavishak, his preoccupation with the written work of and on nineteenth and twentieth century Pittsburgh that framed the working body relates to our second week’s conversation on how historical academic methods can produce material harm. His emphasis on journalism, art criticism, and other written work that served to represent the abstract body, or the representational tension of the laboring body as somehow opposed to the “reading worker” (again, both abstractions), underline the harm abstract intellectualism perpetuates through the conceptualization of physical labor; something we must take into consideration for our own purposes. How, then, might language be the act of resistance that saves the institutions of law and academia from themselves and rectifies the corporeal harm abstraction produces? I end with a quote from an interview with the poet Solmaz Sharif: 

            “I have always been obsessed with State sponsored language and how a violence against bodies is premeditated in a violence against language; how that intersects with the role of the poet as a caretaker of language—if nothing else. And what it might mean to make... the language of the state reckon with the language of the lyric and the language of the self.” (Sharif, “A Political Poetry: Reading and Conversation with Solmaz Sharif”)
