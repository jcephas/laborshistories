			<p>Our seminar discussion two weeks ago on Kenneth Frampton’s architectural interpretations of Hannah Arendt’s notions of “work” and “labor” surfaced a critique of universal categories of the human, which most of us opposed to Karl Marx’s more political and ecological description of the human’s role in the labor process.<a href="#Reference1"><sup>1</sup></a>  However, Jessica Kuskey’s article on the rampant, gruesome workplace injuries suffered by people like Robert Blincoe in nineteenth-century British factories demonstrates that Marx himself may have idealized an impossibly whole “man” whose labor metabolizes “nature” into a product.<a href="#Reference2"><sup>2</sup></a>  Kuskey writes that the children, women, and men employed in Victorian factories left behind gory accounts like the story of an industrial accident which resulted in “clothes and mangled flesh… inextricably mixed together;” others experienced long-term impairments slowly manifested by “repetitive contortion and strain.”<a href="#Reference3"><sup>3</sup></a>  These narratives suggest, <i>pace</i> Marx, that labor not only metabolizes inhuman nature but also eats away at worker’s bodies.</p>
			<p>When the American painter John White Alexander’s mural depicting muscley workers was unveiled at the Carnegie Institute in Philadelphia in 1907, a Dutch commentator proclaimed that “Mr. Carnegie,” by commissioning the fifteen-panel painting, had “taken the glass of pure water – no, not pure, for it is stained with human sweat and material dregs – and suffused it with the red glow of the poet’s and the painter’s wine from heaven.”<a href="#Reference4"><sup>4</sup></a>  The commentator starts with a simple metaphor praising the artwork’s clarity and evocativeness before, somewhat amazingly, correcting himself to specify that the picture also contains a strange admixture of human bodily matter and “pure water.” Edward Slavishak interprets images of working men like those populating Alexander’s mural as idealized “symbol[s] of industrial Pittsburgh” installed by local capitalists as aspirational models meant to compel a profitable social order amidst the discord wrought by industrialization.<a href="#Reference5"><sup>5</sup></a>  In light of the incidents analyzed by Kuskey and the Dutch writer’s recognition that body parts are mixed in with Alexander’s artwork, we can also understand these representations of workers’ bodies as visual prosthetics. Depictions of workers’ bodies as confident, healthy, white, and male – viz., whole and intact – ideologically supplemented the injured and ailing corporealities of actual workers in 19th century Pittsburgh.</p>
			<p>These images not only stand in for fractured working-class subjects, but also reify expectations of workers’ bodily comportments which are inherently gendered, racialized, and ableist. Ava Baron and Eileen Boris’s contention that the working body is “simultaneously signified and signifier,” implies that workers’ performances of socially regulated embodiment have impacts on their material bodies.<a href="#Reference6"><sup>6</sup></a>  This perspective adds an additional stage to Marcel Mauss’s canonical theorization of “techniques of the body” as a tripartite biological, sociological, and psychological enactment of “effective and traditional” actions.<a href="#Reference7"><sup>7</sup></a>  In addition to the dynamic between these three dimensions of human activity, the techniques Mauss theorizes include a relay, a degree of physical blowback that touches back onto the body. A soldier can easily sprain their ankle while marching completely in accordance with their “education.”<a href="#Reference8"><sup>8</sup></a>  Labor’s metabolism implicates the body not only as an active agent but also a material transformed along with nature.</p>
