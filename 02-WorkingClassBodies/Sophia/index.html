		<p>In “The Labour Process and the Valorization Process,” Marx analyzes how the labor process functions defining three main components: “(1) purposeful activity, that is work itself, (2) the object on which that work is performed, and (3) the instruments of that work” (Marx 284). In doing so, he establishes three key terms to define the outputs of these processes: use-value, exchange-value, and surplus-value. Use-value emerges as the product of one working on an object using “instruments of labour,” exchange-value its the worth attributed to goods in comparison to other goods in a capitalist market (and is otherwise distinguished from use-value by the latter’s ability to fulfill human needs), and surplus-value is the profit margin produced by the capitalist selling commodities not in equivalence with the use-value, thus creating an imbalance between labor output and capital gain, or profit. Marx describes the process through which surplus-value emerges as the valorization process: “If the process is not carried beyond the point where the value paid by the capitalist for the labour-power is replaced by an exact equivalent, it is simply a process of creating value; but if it is continued beyond that point, it becomes a process of valorization” (302). As presented, it becomes evident that the means through which the value of labor is obscured comes as a result of profit-seeking behavior; should the capitalist engage in valorization, the means through which commodities are produced are likely misunderstood by the consumer as a result of the disparity within the values of labor. Despite Marx’s articulating that “the [labour] process is extinguished in the product” the moment it is produced, the labour “bound up” in its object can still be preserved through the exchange-value presented in the market should it remain equivalent with the labor output — a possibility Marx might categorize as the “good intentions” with which the “road to hell is paved” (298).</p>
		
		<p>In The Human Condition, Arendt engages with Marx’s work offering another perspective on human’s relationship to nature and their own existence. She describes the different components that she theorizes constitutes the vita activa, or a life engaged with the world through action: labor, work, and action. Focusing on the first two terms, she describes labor as the activities that sustain human life and work as the activities that produce “human artifact,” things that outlast humans and are produced beyond a drive for survival, such as art, which creates the quality of “worldliness” (Arendt 8). She notes a clear distinction between them stating that the only activity which functions distinctly in opposition to work, or towards the “experience of worldlessness” is labor; when engaged in this activity, the human body is trapped in its “own recurring cycle of its own functioning” when engaged with the world strictly to survive (115). Frampton touches on similar themes of infinity through Arendt’s work explaining that the progression of obscuring the presence of labor within the goods being produced allowed “‘blind’ mechanical production” of the 18th century to proliferate (Frampton 35). As though creating a closed loop, he compares this mode of production to Arendt’s commentary on the cyclical nature of society’s ability to consume at an indiscriminate rate: “we must consume, devour, as it were, our houses and furnitures and cars as though they were the ‘good things’ of nature which spoil uselessly if they are not drawn swiftly into the never ending cycle of man’s metabolism with nature” (35).</p>

		<p>When understood as a looping system, Bhattacharya’s understanding of Social Reproduction Theory tightens this imagery; in order to sustain constant production, the system requires more workers to create more labor — workers that can be reproduced via internal means to sustain current workers (ie. food, sleep, kinship network, etc.) or external means to gain more workers (ie. immigration, slavery, etc. and how those communities are sustained). As fabrication becomes “an end in itself,” which Arendt credits the “triumphal victory of exchange value over use value” for creating, this system becomes highly dependent on societal perception and behavior around commodities. When labor output is absorbed and obscured by the object being created, production is pushed to its extremes, reproducing a working class of human bodies implicated in a cycle of consumption and creation, as Arendt describes, “doomed to an infinite progress without ever reaching any inherent telos or approaching any preordained idea” (33).</p>
