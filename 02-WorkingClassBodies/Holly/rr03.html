	<h3>Reading Response 03</h3>
	<p>In David Gissen’s talk at Media and Modernity earlier this week (in which he discussed his work and recent book on architecture and disability), one recurring theme was the concept of “functionalism” as a design paradigm for disabled groups and individuals. Of course the term “functionalism” immediately calls to mind canonical figures from the history of architecture, but Gissen’s interest was less in tracing a genealogy than it was in considering the limitations of architectural theory when designing for bodies which were not the conventionally-imagined subject (white, male, and “able”-bodied). While Gissen’s subjects are not necessarily the same as those which surface in each of this week’s readings, I could not help but reflect on the seemingly engrained paradigm of “functionalism” (meant in the discourses Gissen critiques as a design strategy which places functional use above all over considerations) alongside the related ideals of expediency (as Ava Baron and Eileen Boris discuss), ease of “abstraction” (as Jessica Kuskey shows) and technical prowess (described in different ways by Marcel Mauss and Edward Slavishak) of the laboring body.</p> <space> </space>

	<p>Both the principles of functionalist architectural design and the representations Slavishak describes in his chapter “The Working Body as a Civic Image” are ideals: as demonstrated in the case of figures wearing an ancient tunic published in Pittsburgh at the Dawn of the 20th Century, an ideal that cuts to the core of Western culture’s self-fashioning (Slavishak 104-05). In a sense there is no means of discussing the working body without the “generalizations” that Kuskey describes as indispensable to workers’ reformist agitation (Kurskey 7) and the “abstractions” that Baron and Boris argue “cast gendered, racialized, aged, and disabled working bodies as deviant” (Baron and Boris 24)—an example of this is Slavishak’s chapter on Elizabeth Beardsley Butler’s Women and the Trades, where such characterizations were mobilized as a means of arguing for the exclusion of some laboring bodies. What I take from these texts is that representations of the laboring body nearly always make use of tropes of labor (the heroism of Pittsburgh’s puddlers, for example; Slavishak 107-09) and an idealized human body which belong to longer histories of Western form and figuration. </p>
	<space> </space>
	<p> This is present in Mauss’ description of bodies performing a range of “techniques,” and of the “triple viewpoint” (biological, sociological, and psychological) needed to interpret “technical action” (Mauss 458-461). Writing in 1934, Mauss was describing a sociology of technique only a few years after watershed theories of functionalist design were published. It would be a stretch to claim any correlation between architectural theories and Mauss’ text, but his reflections on the instrumentality of the human body seem akin to the essentializing aims of functionalist design theories: to design architectural spaces so that they optimize and make efficient, almost mechanic, human life. </p>
	<space> </space>
	<p>In critiquing such texts which rely on an abstracted body (while Mauss is not concerned with labor as a singularly important category of “technique,” his approach clearly defines broad categories of human experience) Baron and Boris suggest attention to the spaces and places of labor, as well as the ways in which place informs understandings of the laboring body. Reflecting on the notion of representing the laboring body, it struck me that technologies of such representation have long been fixated on the spaces of labor as a means of triangulating work, cultural production, and capitalist surplus value production (In addition to the work of boosters Slavishak describes, I am thinking of Workers Leaving the Lumiére Factory and its seeming inauguration of film as a medium). In this way spaces of labor retain seemingly contradictory potentials for our investigations into labor and subjectivity. On the one hand, if we are to follow Baron and Boris, they are potent sites for understanding the complex dynamics that construct the laboring subject; on the other hand, they are easily co-opted into aestheticizing the experience of labor. </p>
	<p>The works of memoir that Kurskey describes, with their attention to the danger and brutality of the factory floor, render the space of labor a space of horror. In these examples we see efforts by workers themselves to avoid such aestheticization. Kurskey’s invitation to probe the relationship between “the lived material body” and the “abstraction of the working body employed in class struggle” (Kurskey 8) clearly tracks with Baron and Boris’ interest in reframing and foregrounding a subjective approach to labor; where I find Kurskey most helpful is in her suggestion that these abstracted, generalized depictions of labor have historical and theoretical merit in their own right. Like an idealized functionalism, an ethos of optimization, the abstracted worker reflects less the realities of labor than the aspirations of a society. To illustrate this, I’ll conclude with an image I took a few months ago of an ornament on the facade of a building in Dessau, Germany constructed in the 1960s as a telecommunications office. On the top level of ornament, four workers, seemingly “normalized” in an East German social consciousness (ie., Europeans, where the two men conduct the “hard” labor of manufacturing and two women act as operators); on the bottom, four recipients of GDR communications technology, each seemingly from a different part of the socialist sphere of influence. Here, rendering the nonwhite “receivers” of GDR technology indicates a hierarchy of bodies producing its products—more telling of the GDR’s desire for global influence than the realities of its technology sector. </p>
