		In this week’s collections of reading, the body is the unifying framework. When the body is read against previous lectures and discussions we’ve had around subject formation and subjectivity, our authors argue that body can be understood as the site for the mechanisms of subject formation. As a result, the body seems to be the common site between the course’s two key interests: labor and subjectivity.<br> <br>

		As the body is approach through the lens of the “working body” and thus the instrument of labor in all but one of this week’s readings, the body’s relationship to labor is made apparent. Yet, this week’s readings also frame the body as both the site of domination and agency, exactly as we have previously seen in discussions of subject formation. In the conclusion of Mauss’s discussion of bodily techniques he notes that the “physio-psycho-sociological assemblages” which constitute bodily behavior elucidate a particular causal relationship between individuals and society: “it is thanks to society that there is an intervention of consciousness… it is thanks to society that there is the certainty of pre-pared movements, domination of the conscious over emotion and unconsciousness” (Mauss, 475). Here, we are reminded heavily of a key concept in the theorization of subject formation: that subjecthood arises through subjectification. Through a nascent understanding of bodily techniques, Mauss is able to raise these questions of society’s relationship to subjecthood as read through consciousness, emotion, and unconsciousness, and through explicit terms such as “domination.” 
		Such a perspective is presented in Kuskey’s text through a simple question: “what kind of life could have produced this body” (Kuskey, 4). Here, Mauss’s analysis of the uses and techniques of the body as they relate to society is refocused on the material reality of the body, per se. While Mauss reminds us of through the body that subject formation’s depends on moments of action and associated techniques (recognition, for example), Kuskey’s provocative question suggests that the marks of domination on the body are present without action, as might be necessary for a working theory of subjecthood. <br><br>

		Hall’s understanding of recognition as a site for potential agency and resistance is reflected in Baron and Boris’s adamant reading of the body as a site for resistance: “one does not simply have a body in the sense of a thing that someone possesses, but one also is a body” (Baton, 26). While recognition is the site of subjectification, it is equally the site for resistance and human agency. The body is read in a nearly identical fashion in Baron and Boris, where bodies express “social anxieties and class identities” in an extension of Mauss’s argument, but also act as sites to “undermine power relations” (Baton, 26). <br> <br>

		Finally, Slavishak offers an understanding of this relationship between subjectivity and the body which centers around representation. In his chapter on the image of the body, we may reread the representations of bodies against a framework of representations of subjectivity itself. As we have seen our authors treat the body similarly to how we have conceptualized of the subject, we may now reintroduce the subject into Slavishak’s historical understanding of the body’s symbolic and civic role. Is the body the representation of the subject, which in turn gets imaged and represented in Slavishak’s Pittsburgh? Threads throughout this week’s readings suggest as much.
