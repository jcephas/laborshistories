				In the readings for this week, all of the writers are reading bodies in some way. The first three texts all present some form of an invitation to read bodies, whether that be ethnologically in Mauss’ case, or historically in the case of the other two. This trilogy of works all make a call for a change in intellectual engagement with the body, but how they think the body should be read, and, indeed, how and what they understand the legible surfaces of the body to be present some differences. In this regard, post-structuralist theory of bodies as constituting and constituted by their historical socio-political circumstances seem important to these readings. The two chapters from Slavishak’s book analyse the attempts through which representations of working bodies have been used to curate a symbolic significance that surpasses in meaning (and perhaps even obliterates) the working body itself. </p>

				Marcel Mauss asks us to read the human body as a site of symbolic significance by investigating the mechanisms that lie behind our social habiti. He suggests that we constantly deal with physio-psycho-sociological assemblages of series of actions, which are enacted in a constant process of adaptation towards their aims, and which are assembled by and for an authority. These habiti that Mauss finds in the miscellany drawer of human social phenomena represent a continuity of behavioural concatenations which are primarily sociologically motivated and therefore assimilable with the idea of consciousness as its own assemblage of symbolic systems. For Mauss, the sociological component here dominates over the psychological and the physiological because each ‘technique of the body’ is essentially always a repetition that indicates the internalisation of an authority. Although I am sure Mauss’ choice of examples might now be used to disprove the basis of his argumentation (both morally and empirically), there is much in this 1934 piece that seems strikingly prescient. In particular, Mauss’ advocacy for what can be read in bodies (‘bodies’ being the technical object and means of an authoritatively determined repetition) seems very relevant to the points about Foucault and Butler I will bring up in relation to other readings. One of the major differences between Mauss and the other writers is that he reads bodies from an ethnological perspective, without the emphasis on historical contingency that marks the other works, and with an eye to contemporary debates about eugenics. </p>

				In her piece on Victorian factory workers, Jessica Kuskey highlights the divide between the abstracted body produced by statistics and surveys for reading, and the raw materiality of the bodies synthesised and elided in that abstraction. In this respect, Kuskey’s historical perspective points to an all too essential dissonance between discourse (abstraction) and materiality (the concrete). Notably, Kuskey’s case studies reflect the fact that the reports that informed the creation of the abstract ‘working body’ relied on a kind of dual production of legibility of individual examples. Workers’ bodies are produced for reading both in text (through printed accounts of their accidents), and in front of Parliament (a worker’s scars and ‘deformities’ are displayed as inscriptions in their bodies to be interpreted by the onlookers). In both cases, the production of a legible surface anticipates a reader, but more importantly, anticipates and disciplines itself to the mode of authority by which it anticipates its surface will be read. Where Mauss asks his listeners to read the ‘techniques of the body’ without reflecting on readership as a position of power, Kuskey seems tacitly to recognise the power of the reader. Namely, Kuskey appears to acknowledge that if we accept Foucault’s suggestion that ‘the processes of the activity rather than its result’ are the operations of discipline (embodied power) (Discipline and Punish, 136), then the reading of a body is still an act embedded within the processes of discipline.

				Ava Baron and Eileen Boris top off this trilogy of invitations to the body’s legibility by proffering a ‘triple viewpoint’, which accounts for the materiality Kuskey believed lacking in her own piece. Baron and Boris argue that ‘the body’ can offer a category for historical analysis, but that, owing to the body’s status as both signifier (what is written) and signified (what is read), there is an undeniable complexity to the reading that must take place. Thus, the proposal of a triple viewpoint that accounts for: 1) the body as constructed through discourse and representations of itself; 2) the body as subject to technologies of power and as a site of discipline; 3) the body as a material presence. This tripartite approach reminds me of Judith Butler’s explanation of sex in Bodies that matter, in that it points to the inevitable materiality of the body as a presence, as well as the ways that the other two parts (discourse and discipline) construe and contrive the ‘material effects’ of those bodies. Significantly, though, whereas Mauss views the body as humanity’s most natural tool and means which is made compatible with an idea of consciousness as a symbolic system through his approach to behaviour, for Baron and Boris, the body has already become a deeply unstable sign.

				The two Slavishak chapters are somewhat different from the other three pieces, by virtue of the fact that they concern themselves less with advocating for ‘reading bodies’, than the ways in which bodies have been historically constructed to be read. I would think that, theoretically speaking, Slavishak comes from a similar position to Baron and Boris, but that his exercise is ultimately one that engages not just with the fact that all bodies are legible de facto as historically generated and generating systems of meaning, but that at this point in the history of Pittsburgh, there was a conscious and concerted effort to produce (artistic or statistical) representations of bodies which would be read in a particular way. In the first of the two chapters, Slavishak interprets the strategic symbolic logic behind representations of labour in turn-of-the-century Pittsburgh: workers’ bodies become metonyms for work, and these ‘working bodies’, in turn, are employed as civic symbols. This very specific attempt to curate meaning poses a number of problems, firstly regarding the overdetermination of meaning and, secondly, the inevitable retreat from meaning to spectacle when overdetermination proves flawed. In the second chapter, Slavishak probes the question as to why women’s bodies were represented neither in the spectacle produced by the city ‘boosters’, nor the discourse of the social reformers. He draws on Elizabeth Butler’s contemporary analysis of working women’s bodies. Butler reads bodies, but she, like Mauss, obfuscates her power as a reader, instead extrapolating ‘women’s problems’ from ‘women’s bodies’ in line with her own moral viewpoint. In both Slavishak’s chapters, we are confronted with narrativisations of the body that can serve as propaganda, but where we do not turn is towards the effects of these narratives onto the bodies from which they have been read. Does the symbolic value of the ‘working body’ alienate the worker from their own body? (In the 1994 film, Serp i molot, a Stalinist-era woman longs to be the perfect Stakhanovite and so undergoes gender reassignment surgery, because only a man could achieve her dream. The ensuing gender dysmorphia and self-alienation drives the hero to attempt to assassinate Stalin, only then to be forced into a vegetative state and locked inside a museum-house dedicated to their own heroism.)

				Michel Foucault, Discipline and Punish (1975) ‘…discipline produces subjected and practised bodies, “docile” bodies. Discipline increases the forces of the body (in economic terms of utility) and diminishes these same forces (in political terms of obedience). In short, it dissociates power from the body; on the one hand, it turns it into an “aptitude”, a “capacity”, which it seeks to increase; on the other hand, it reverses the course of the energy, the power that might result from it, and turns it into a relation of strict subjection. If economic exploitation separates the force and the product of labour, let us say that disciplinary coercion establishes in the body the constricting link between an increased aptitude and an increased domination’ (p.138)

				Judith Butler, Bodies that matter (1993) ‘When, in Lacanian parlance, one is said to assume a “sex”, the grammar of the phrase creates the expectation that there is a "one" who, upon waking, looks up and deliberates on which “sex” it will assume today, a grammar in which “assumption” is quickly assimilated to the notion of a highly reflective choice. But if this “assumption” is compelled by a regulatory apparatus of heterosexuality, one which reiterates itself through the forcible production of “sex”, then the “assumption” of sex is constrained from the start. And if there is agency, it is to be found, paradoxically, in the possibilities opened up in and by that constrained appropriation of the regulatory law, by the materialization of that law, the compulsory appropriation and identification with those normative demands. The forming, crafting, bearing, circulation, signification of that sexed body will not be a set of actions performed in compliance with the law; on the contrary, they will be a set of actions mobilized by the law, the citational accumulation and dissimulation of the law that produces material effects, the lived necessity of those effects as well as the lived contestation of that necessity. Performativity is thus not a singular “act”, for it is always a reiteration of a norm or set of norms, and to the extent that it acquires an actlike status in the present, it conceals or dissimulates the conventions of which it is a repetition’ (p.12)
