			<p class=center-text>In his 1934 essay, “Techniques of the Body,” French sociologist/anthropologist Marcell Mauss argues that human bodies are conditioned by society. In fact, the movement of bodies, their cadence, rhythm, relative strength, and abilities to conform to different shapes and patterns become the basis for identifying traits associated with a range of social categories: American or French, male or female, and adult or child. According to Mauss, “In group life as a whole, there is a kind of education of movements in close order.” That is, as collectives of bodies, we learn to move and act in certain ways that reflect our place within the specific social order, which is particular to a national context. For Mauss, bodies correspond to categories of the social scientist, thus they display the range captured by statistics, revealing the specific frames through which the sociologist or anthropologist is able to conceive of social behavior in the 1930s. What Mauss leaves out is that each of these categories is, by definition, flawed. A national body leaves out regional difference. A male or female body leaves out nonbinary or gender non-conforming bodies. An adult or child body leaves out an adolescent body. While these categories have clearly multiplied and been treated with increased nuance in the nearly 90 years since Mauss’s article, thinking though the body can and should be done in dialectical terms. Jessica Kuskey understands that the “abstract body” of the worker is produced by the machinery of industrial capitalist production. In producing this generalized notion of a body, capitalism both swallows it up and also gives workers a rallying cry for improvements. In creating the machinery to efficiently produce unfathomable quantities of commodities—by fueling progress—capitalism both creates the conditions for the mangling of bodies, but also for a new kind of previously unimaginable repair. A metal stamping machine might mangle the finger, but the surgeon can fix it (only to send the worker back to the factory floor). Furthermore, the creation of the “working body” gives laborers the ability to demand protections for this body, shorter working hours, weekends for the body’s repose, etc. Yet, as Ava Baron and Eileen Boris argue in their essay, “’The Body’ as a Useful Category for Working-Class History,” it is exactly this Western concept of the body that has also served to privilege white male bodies over those of everyone else, with non-white, non-male bodies, and disabled bodies marginalized. Thus, “bodies have served as the terrain to reproduce gender, race, and class hierarchies.” (43) This is certainly the case for Edward Slavikash, whose case studies on Pittsburgh reveal the way in which the body of the worker in an early-twentieth-century industrial city was often a tool for male workers and capitalists to conspire to reduce the amount of power women and immigrants, for example, had in society. Thus, the body is both produced by capitalism and an object for social movements and scholars alike. All of the week’s readings underscore how important it is to question labor histories’ own blind spots in overemphasizing the same white male body as the rallying cry for struggle and scholarship..</p>
