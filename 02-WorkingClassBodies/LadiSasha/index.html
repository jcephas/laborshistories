		<h4>Reading Response #3</h4>
		
		<p>How does space reproduce race? How does space, and particularly the city, produce the worker? These questions stem from my reading of Ava Baron and Eileen Boris’ text. Pulled directly from the following statement, “Race making takes place in time and space.”[1] Baron and Boris go on to describe the relational effects between body and space, “Space and the body are interrelated, contributing to the production of certain kinds of bodies. Indeed, the body itself has been conceptualized as space—a location within which an individual resides.” [2] This inquiry into space, and more directly, the city’s role in producing the worker is taken up in Edward Stavishak’s texts. Stavishak’s historicizing around Pittsburgh from various actors - from gender to art - gives us various annotations to approach an answer to this question in relation to the industrial development and urbanization of a city. These chapters also helped me to reflect on a question that lingered from Jessica Kursey’s essay: what are the markings of culture onto the laboring body? Kursey’s signifier and signifying construction around the working body is also a part of this idea of the body being produced by space while also being sited as a location within itself.  Kursey’s proposition to further investigate the distinction between the lived material body and the laboring body is productive in thinking about the embodiment or corporeality of work at large. Here is where Marcel Mauss’ writing can enter. Mauss’ index of bodily categorization can be considered and accounted for on this subject of embodiment for what it offers on the imposition of quotidian tradition onto actions and techniques. This categorization leads to a set of effective and intellectual symbols that may pull us closer to defining how culture marks the body.</p>

		<p>Together, the readings are pushing me to question how to effectively produce a record or an account of the laboring body? As illustrated from the texts, modes of testimony, categorization, and constructing symbols of action and movement are offered as viable methods. However, there were several moments where the language and terminology deployed referenced and reinforced ideological assumptions around abstraction and materiality in relation to the body that was troubling. For instance, the working body is situated as an abstraction or abstract material across a few of the texts. However, I understand that this location of “worker” is not an abstraction for working class people themselves, which is actually presented in a few of the voices that are included. To be a worker is not a distant condition, but a real and intimate one. Disembodiment from one’s working condition seems to me an alarming theoretical assumption or flaw. Which begs the question, an abstraction for whom? </p>
