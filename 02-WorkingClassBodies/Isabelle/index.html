			<p>Despite the extraordinarily brute and facile distinctions about bodily dispositions (more or less unsupported by convincing evidence), Mauss’ study on the techniques of the body does offer an interesting perspective on the body as an assemblage of socio-pyscho-biological actions/processes. For me, this situates the body in equivalences that are constitutively and fundamentally shaped by various spaces—physical, psychic, and social environments in which the human subject and body labors. Kuskey’s call for a materialist theory of the working body locates a crucial gap between an individual’s own bodily lived experience and its abstracted status, whereby the labor it produces is translated into deviance, lost wages, and trauma (perhaps like the “nervous work” of Slavishak’s later chapter) made calculable or measurable against the capacity of that abstracted body to project profits. In such a site of class struggle, Baron and Boris front a question of embodiment (of how labor is embodied). To write an “embodied working class history” would mean attending to foundational assumptions about the working body and the historical processes in which it has been made. Class is made manifest through bodily dispositions that package dynamics of difference. Embodied labor points to the discursive, epistemic regimes that have privileged some bodies over others—for example, the contests over bodily representations of work and the practices employed to aesthetically manage or control laboring bodies, which Slavishak writes about in both chapters—and specifically, in the spectacular representations of labor on display in the boosterist project of civic image-making even in the actual absence of work or the working body itself.

			<p>But across the readings this week, I found myself particularly interested in how the body comes to be ambiguously coded and marked. For example, Slavishak examines how the immigrant, female body was defined against the bodily spectacle of Pittsburgh and stratified in reformist surveys like Butler’s in order to uphold the socially reproductive role of women in sustaining the familial structures capitalism relies on. In such instances, the human subject is a body, but that body appears (at times) almost never “human” to begin with, vacillating in the hybridity or blurriness between what is “real” and what is “false” or prostheses (machine), as social and class categorizations attempt to grasp at an empty or emptied “identity” (and this perhaps pushes us towards tricky questions about ontology). This body—neither object or subject but <i>resource</i>—seems to engender a double-bind in which it sustains the state and capital at the same time as is its life seemingly threatens its flourishing. And this working (class) body is extra-visible, but it is defined by its capacity (or incapacity) to withstand the hurt or harm of labor. So to lean on our previous conversations on the fragmented body, perhaps the fantasy of a white, male, working body and desires for an immigrant surface or flesh emptied of interiority share common origin.
