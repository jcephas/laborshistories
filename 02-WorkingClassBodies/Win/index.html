    The readings present a relational framework between the societal constructs of gender and labor <span class="play">perform</span>ativity, both of which emanate (in parallel? perpendicularly?) from the human <span class="pulse">body</span>. The former, dealt with most directly by Baron and Boris, reminds us that one has—but also is—a <span class="pulse">body</span>. <span class="pulse">Bodies</span> provide the only interface we have with the world (for now), and as our sole corporeal vehicle, we are dependent on them for survival, and for all the work required to survive, including the maintenance of said <span class="pulse">body</span>. The thing is, every <span class="pulse">body</span> is different, so laboring <span class="pulse">bodies</span> endure and thus eventually behave differently. A dependence on the <span class="pulse">body</span> disproportionally affects some people more than others, complicating labor-centric ideologies. Those who cannot labor are erased from such narratives. Slavishak depicts an historic manifestation of how the “delicately built” <span class="pulse">body</span> of a woman labored with “nervous speed,” burning out faster than the <span class="pulse">body</span> of a man, in turn producing a sideline that favored gendered roles of male labor and female domesticity. Kuskey’s text em<span class="pulse">bodies</span> this wrought of labor vividly in the story of Mary Richards—whose horrors will likely sit with me forever.<sup>1</sup>

<p>
    In his earlier chapter, Slavishak shifts his 19th-century Pittsburgh-based analysis from the <span class="play">perform</span>ance of sexed <span class="pulse">bodies</span> to that of labor itself. The branding of the city through the exaltation of the muscular <span class="pulse">body</span> of the male artisan privileges the spectacle of labor’s <span class="play">perform</span>ance over its product. Mauss’ amusing encyclopedia of <span class="pulse">bodi</span>ly <span class="play">perform</span>ances, closer in time to Slavishak’s subjects than to Slavishak, allows Slavishak’s point to be em<span class="pulse">bodied</span> within another text once again. The relation between the texts, as well as the relation between the various forms of <span class="play">perform</span>ance discussed within them and in my text above, point to a <span class="play">perform</span>ative understanding over one based entirely in labor. Labor produces, but it can also be a product. Its <span class="play">perform</span>ance matters not only in terms of efficiency and learnability/accessibility. It can become a <span class="play">perform</span>ance in itself, and in doing so transforms processes of labor and work into acts of, well, acting. The laborer is in a play, and in turn is playing. The lens of <span class="play">perform</span>ance thus lends a useful perspective for my research interest in the role of play within productive processes, and how systems can incorporate otherwise frivolous elements that might typically detract or be seen as distractions in productively exploitative ways. I began with a parenthetical about the relation of the trajectories of gender and labor <span class="play">perform</span>ativity, and finally I come full circle: they are tangential. Productive processes eventually incorporate tangential vectors like play into their mechanisms.

<sup>1</sup>Or at least until my mind goes: there is something in this vein worth exploring further about the endurance of the mind and <span class="pulse">body</span> over a lifetime. Dementia reverses Mary Richard’s “constitutional” perseverance of mind over <span class="pulse">body</span> by having the ability of the <span class="pulse">body</span> outlast that of the mind.
