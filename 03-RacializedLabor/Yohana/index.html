            If the history of racial capitalism holds implications for the practice of architecture, how have the changing strategies of racial ideologies transformed the historical definitions of architecture, its notions of authorship, and its disciplinary adjacencies? This question’s relevance first emerges through relating Robinson, Roediger, and Trotter.

            Robinson’s notions of racial capitalism as a construct of the differencing between racial categories of labor plays out through the production of the “inferior” or “savage” Other [1]. Similarly, Roediger’s argument that the white urban worker “connected their freedom and their work” further confirms that this practice played out in American landscapes through the dichotomous metric of free labor, associated with whiteness, and Black slave labor [2]. Then, following Roediger, the architectural implication for labor that assumes whiteness resides in his inclusion of mechanic consciousness. This barometer of what constitutes a useful or specialized commodity hinges on the worker’s mobility to become an independent master, thus pointing back to Robinson’s assertion that the development of capitalism followed “the social and ideological composition of a civilization that had assumed its fundamental perspectives during feudalism” [3]. Mechanic consciousness offers a lens to perceive the practice of architecture as bound to a similar psychology, where architects who also consider themselves to be “men professing an ingenious art” separate their labor from those who participate in the construction and maintenance of the built environment. The racialized labor of the latter produces discrete labor markets, which then enables the capitalist to manipulate how the discipline of architecture can evolve through strategic racial ideologies, which is further revealed by Trotter. Trotter makes evident that the specialized knowledge and craft acquired by Black workers alloted those enslaved “opportunities to cultivate ‘semi-independent lives within the boundaries of bondage’” [4]. His assertions–when read alongside Roediger’s writing about the white laborer’s post-Revolution imaginative fear of being in close proximity to the Black slave–suggest an opportunity for social mobility conditionally afforded to the Black artisan that would quickly become undermined in architectural production by the early nineteenth century. Parallel to (or in conjunction with) the efforts of the American Colonization Society existed the architect’s embrace of steel and concrete as motive to undermine and ultimately dispose of skilled-crafts workers from the production of buildings [5]. This embrace for numerically controlled concrete that dominated mid-to-late nineteenth technological development and twentieth century modernist architecture, an obsession still present today, while severely reducing the human labor needed to construct the built environment must also be understood through the strategic racial ideologies all of these authors posit.

            Lastly, the splitting of labor between racial groups is further nuanced through a relational reading across Cephas and Jones, and it pulls the phenomenological construction of place into conversation with the aforementioned positions of race, labor, and the built environment. If, as Jones writes, the “purpose of racial ideologies as a strategy… [creates] highly effective barrier (backed by law and physical force) between groups of people living and working in proximity to each other,” a further division of the Black worker might be understood through a Northerner/Southerner dichotomy [6]. The insidious reality of portraying the migration of Black workers from the South as an abandonment of their home and the homes of their forefathers–included in Cephas’ essay–forces onto the Black worker phenomenologies of placemaking and homemaking vis-à-vis their identity, one that then belongs to the South. This, of course, neglects the historical realities of slavery, and it fabricates a subjective binary split of the Black laborer into an assumed “superior” Southern Black worker as opposed to their “inferior” Northern counterpart. If we then take Jones’ call to broaden our understanding of the role of racial ideologies in issuing labor patterns, we might identify further subdivisions of similar fashions across timescales, geographies, and various constructs of ethnicities and nationalities.
