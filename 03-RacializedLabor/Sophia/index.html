		<p>Discussions of visibility imply a relationship: the body which is being viewed (or not viewed) and those who engage in the act of viewing. Though there is much to consider in terms of personal agency in “presenting” and “performing,” this reflection is tightly focused on how visibility functions within these texts. In “Techniques of the Body,” Mauss writes encouraging the consideration for the human “body” as an “instrument” that performs many actions with varied meanings (Mauss 461). He insists that much can be learned from observing bodies and what is created in relation to them. For instance, he describes how analyzing the construction of chairs can give insight into how certain groups of people sit or squat: “The way of sitting down is fundamental. You can distinguish squatting mankind and sitting mankind. And, among the latter, people with benches and people without benches and daises; people with chairs and people without chairs. Wooden chairs support by crouching figures are widespread…” (468). However, what Mauss might find shocking given some of his gendered, resolute conclusions, the body does not necessarily portray everything.</p>

		<p>In “‘The Body’ as a Useful Category for Working-Class History,” Baron and Boris write on how rules in the workplace have historically functioned to control bodies and force them into specific ways of presenting. In this discussion, they emphasize how in response to these systems, the way in which workers present in opposition to those rules, either by queering one’s appearance against the norms of the time or by disregarding the rules altogether, function as a means of embodying agency. Highlighting this, they conclude with an invitation to consider the “working body” beyond its categorization as a “site of pain, where sweat and toil are not one’s own:” “Thus we end with a call for consideration of the body also as a site of resistance and recognition of its liberating potential, as working people have understood it, not only outside the strictures of work discipline but through the joy of labor itself” (Baron and Boris 43). Here the act of resistance through presenting and leveraging this visibility of the body is a negotiation of control when one is forced into being visible or otherwise “[inculcated]” to become invisible to blend in at one’s “low-waged service” position (29).</p>

		<p>Kuskey touches on a similar deployment of agency as well in “The Working Body: Re-forming the Factory Body.” In this work, she discusses how presenting one’s bodily changes from injury or repeated actions in the workplace was one way that the hardships of one’s labor, which were frequently obscured, could be seen and validated, as in the case of Blincoe testifying in front of Parliament. Similarly, the work of Slavishak touches on the leveraging of appearance as well; his work raises the question, when the labor is made invisible or hidden from view, what fills that void? In Bodies of Work: Civic Display and Labor in Industrial Pittsburgh, he discusses a wave in Pittsburgh, a city defined by its factory industries, to have public art represent their laborers. Of the qualms that resulted during this time, Slavishak describes one disagreement concerning a statue of a laborer being depicted without his shirt on — a detail that garnered both positive and negative attention. This example called into question both the body of a male laborer being viewed as something to admire or glorify while also highlighting a public, ignorance regarding the actual, lived conditions of these working environments. Here Slavishak highlights how the lack of visibility of this labor allows a constructed or fabricated image of the laborer’s body to occupy the cultural consciousness at the time. Similarly, when speaking of the agency of those witnessing subjectivity, he discusses the writings of Butler and how her single, biased view of female laborers working influenced how certain bodies were perceived as participants in the work force: some bodies were viewed as delicate and discrete while those (already) marginalized were grouped and described as “earth-toughened,” as though their bodies were designed for heavier, harsher labor (Slavishak 207).</p>

		<p>Negotiating how bodies are perceived, whether as the one being viewed or the one engaging in the act of viewing, against prominent social constructions in society can either exact control or activate agency — both actions that demonstrate the power that bodies can possess. Though narrow in his conclusions when read against today’s social backdrop, Mauss makes a salient point that can be read across these texts: bodies, as far as they are understood as “instruments,” carry a multitude of meanings based on the smallest changes in movements alone (Mauss 461). When deployed, as Baron and Boris suggest, perhaps that is when “joy” within the embodiment of one’s agency is cultivated (Baron and Boris 43).</p>
