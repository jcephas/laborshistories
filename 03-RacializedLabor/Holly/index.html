   <p>  As in our previous discussion on the working class body, themes of visibility are central in each of this week’s readings. In particular, I am interested in how each text takes up the troubling slippage between the realities of nonwhite labor (primarily in North America from the colonial period to the early twentieth century) and the dominance of a narrative which minimizes, denigrates, and erases such labor in our social imaginary. This is at once a reductive problematic (it’s certainly not debatable that the cultural and economic imperatives of American history have been served by such erasure) and, as we see in each text, a fundamental disparity that can be seen across temporal and social scales. From Cedric Robinson’s contention that  immigrant labor was a central yet understudied aspect of the development of European economies to David Roediger’s description of the white worker as an identity emergent out of the specific dynamics of American class and race relations in the 19th century, each of these readings offers an important and nuanced insight into ways of “seeing” the racialized working body. </p>

  <p>In her reflection on the changing nature of scholarship on labor in the American South, Jacqueline Jones points to a changing tendency toward “ever-shifting ideas of racial difference” and the “fluidity of racial ideologies across time and space” (Jones 613). This reflection resonates with (in perhaps a very crude sense) the most instructive aspect of Robinson’s chapter: his illustration of the ways in which difference, and not homogenization, was a constituent construct in European civilization (an argument made directly on Robinson 26). Both Robinson and Jones make a powerful contention in reflecting on the fungible nature of Black and nonwhite identity, though it seems to me that in spite of coming from a book titled Black Marxism, Robinson’s comments are likely intended as a rebuttal to Marx’s concept of capitalism as an economic system that eventually subsumes nearly all forms of human productivity as commodities (as an aside, I wonder too to what degree this is really a novel claim: I am thinking of Gramsci’s concepts of “cultural hegemony” and “wars of position” as means of complicating, not prescribing, a dominant cultural position within a given capitalist society). Regardless of the ways one might critique Robinson’s ideas, other texts support his argument that “the effects of racialism were bound to appear in the social expression of every strata of every European society” (Robinson 28): consider, for example, Roediger’s citation of Winthrop Jordan’s of the “animus toward things and people who were dark” as a “powerful force in the British worldview” prior to the founding of Jamestown in the early 17th century (Roediger 23); or Jones’s description of the “inconsistent” characterizations of Black enslaved laborers over time, inconsistencies which reflect the changing need to instrumentalize notions of racial difference (Jones 615, in a description which tracks with Roediger’s thesis on the emergence of the “white worker”). Robinson’s argument thus helps us attend to the ways in which we “see” Black and other forms of nonwhite labor in American history: not simply as obfuscated or erased for the sake of a narrative of white industriousness, but always already an “other” culturally and rhetorically constructed to meet the changing needs of white America. </p>

  <p>Of these texts, Jay Cephas’s discussion of chain gangs in early 20th century Georgia and their implications for “landscape production” and “modernization” is perhaps the clearest example of the complexities of imaging and imagining race at a moment in time, as well as the implications of such visualizations on the present day: not only did Black chain gang serve as a disciplinary reminder for the white public and as a marker of the “worked” Georgian landscape, they were also laborers fundamental to the construction of modernity (I will say, again, that in both cases they were “instrumentalized”). Here two different modes of vision become necessary: on the one hand, as Cephas shows, chain gangs reinforced longstanding ideas about punishment and public humiliation in the US (Cephas 132); on the other, they were crucial to developing roads and thus connection communities in rural Georgia (Cephas 140), a marker of modernization in the American south. This duality recalls Joe William Trotter’s investigation into the development of the Black enslaved population and working class as “indispensable to the growth and development of the new [American] nation” (Trotter 3) and simultaneously subject to the racist constraints of the white ruling class on class mobility and positionality within a changing labor market (for example, Trotter’s citation of Frederick Douglass on Black barbers on 123, that “talents [for poetry] so commanding… should be tied to the handle of a razor”). As my finally project looks to map spaces of racialized life and labor, I take the importance of this dual character of visibility very seriously: in my case study of Black Mozambican <i>Vertragsarbeiter</i> in East Germany, laborers were both representative of a state aspiration for modernization (evidenced in their employment in various industries seeking to keep up with and pace “the West”) and also representative of a desire (as I think my still-in progress spatial data in my data set will allow me to argue) of a desire to keep Black and other nonwhite bodies on the margins of GDR communities. </p>
