			<p>All five texts this week examine the historical connections between race and labor, raising questions such as: How have racial and capitalist ideologies intersected and mutually informed one another? And, how have categories of racial difference become synchronized with or deracinated from class identities, and to what ends? This week’s authors each demonstrate the protean ties between racial constructs and productive relations, positing historiographies of race and capitalism at odds with those critiqued by Jacqueline Jones as “Whiggish” narratives of “an unbroken arc from slavery to free labor throughout American and southern history.”<a href="#Reference1"><sup>1</sup></a>  Instead, these texts show that racial formations of labor and capitalist instrumentalizations of race are both contingent upon history and geography.</p>
			<p>Cedric Robinson argues that “European civilization” was always based on racial hierarchies and, therefore, various stages of capitalism have similarly incorporated racialist social structures: “the character of capitalism can only be understood in the social and historical context of its appearance.”<a href="#Reference2"><sup>2</sup></a>  According to Robinson, capitalism absorbs and reproduces structures of social differentiation as a means to perpetuate and justify the dominance of the bourgeoisie, which by the 16th century had become integrated with the absolutist state. “The tendency of European civilization through capitalism,” Robinson writes, was “to exaggerate regional, subcultural, and dialectical differences into ‘racial’ ones.”<a href="#Reference3"><sup>3</sup></a>  These narratives suggest, <i>pace</i> Marx, that labor not only metabolizes inhuman nature but also eats away at worker’s bodies. Put differently, this system of production relied upon the presence of racialized others to provide the labor and material necessities to sustain the dominant classes. The most important implications of Robinson’s argument, I believe, is in its repositioning of social domination based on race as prior to capitalism, thereby replacing what Robinson sees as Marxism’s “determinant economic rationality” with contingency and disequilibrium.<a href="#Reference4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>  
			<p>In the one chapter assigned, Robinson’s conclusions depend on broad moves through world history, with the consequence that relatively granular interstices of racial capitalism, such as appear in the texts by Jay Cephas, David Roediger, and Joe Trotter, remain implicit. Trotter argues that while black workers were essential to the economic development of colonial North America, their social status as a laboring class was continually elaborated in response to the structures imposed by white settlers.<a href="#Reference5"><sup>5</sup></a>  Roediger’s analysis dovetails with Trotter’s by demonstrating that the construction of the “white worker” entailed conjoining racial and labor identities in ways unimaginable prior to the Revolutionary War and its mobilization of an ideology of political and economic freedom. Race and class operated independently in the colonial era, Roediger argues, before early Republican ideals of self-determination were delineated in opposition to black enslavement.<a href="#Reference6"><sup>6</sup></a>  In both Trotter and Roediger’s accounts, historical agency is ascribed to neither race nor class alone, but to the specificities of their linkages.</p>
			<p>Cephas’s study of the black convict labor used to build modern infrastructure in the American South during the 19th and 20th reveals that race and labor were mutually articulated through a third term, landscape. Like Roediger, Cephas argues that racial formations of labor emerged through a dialectic, promoted by whites, opposing black unfreedom to white freedom. In the case of roadwork, this opposition became associated with the land itself so that the relative proximity of different kinds of labor to the earth produced racial distinctions.<a href="#Reference7"><sup>7</sup></a>  As demonstrated by all the readings this week, the ties between race and labor have never been straight-forward, but rather components of specific historical conditions.</p>
