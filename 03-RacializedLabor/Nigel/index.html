    <h2>Racialized Labor:</h2>
    <p>
    	Throughout this week’s readings on racial capitalism, the key terms of “rationalization” and “negation” frequently appear and provide a lens to understand the relationships between blackness, whiteness, and labor. Through sociocultural acts of rationalization and negations, the contradiction between wage and slave/forced labor within racial capitalist modes of production, the works of each of this week’s authors may be understood and compared.

    <h2>Rationalization, Negation, and Contradiction</h2>
    <p> 
    	Cedric Robinson introduces our two key terms in introduction and conclusion of his chapter “Racial Capitalism: The Nonobjective Character of Capitalist Development” in Black Marxism. In the introduction, he writes that “capitalism was less a catastrophic revolution (negation) of feudalist social orders than the extension of these social relations into the larger tapestry of the modern world's political and economic relations," while towards the end of the chapter he writes that “race became largely the rationalization for the domination, exploitation, and/or extermination of non-‘Europeans’” (Robison, 10 & 27). For Robison, these terms are not isolated, but interdependent in the formation of racial capitalism: negation is key form of rationalization of capitalist phenomena and can be seen in the social conceptualizations of both class (bourgeois revolution as negating feudalism) and race (occurring as a negative, rationalization of European/non-European relations). As Robinson unpacks the historical importation of race as a social organizer and concept into capitalist societies, rationalization and negation are staged on a macro-economic scale, dealing with the large, historical movements of peoples and power. Turning Robinson’s terms towards other authors of the week allows us to understand how race, negation, and rationalization relate to the embodied specifics of capitalist production. <br><br>
		For David R. Roediger, the mechanism of negation which drives race within racial capitalist modes of production is directly tied to the individual laborers within the system. Charting the relationship between black and white workers around the American Revolution, Roediger analyzes a complex spectrum of freedom which was supplanted by binary race-relations later in American history. As he writes, "the proximity of unfree whites and Black chattel slaves on a continuum of oppression helped create sympathies that ensured that the 'contagion of liberty' during and after the upheaval of the Revolution would result in attacks on racial slavery as well as on indentured servitude" (Roediger, 30), yet what began to breakdown such a continuum was that "critically,  white urban workers connected their freedom and their work" ( Roediger, 33). The conceptualization of their work within the individualized wage-labor system created a raced a rationalized conception of freedom: “but freeman had its opposite: slave” (Roediger, 33). <br><br>
		While in Jay Cephas and Joe William Trotter’s pieces we can see a showcase of the manifestations and multiplicities of negation as a mechanism of rationalization and naturalization in their studies of chain gangs and the development of the black working class., Jacqueline Jones’s essay urges us to consider “the fluidity of racial ideologies across time and spaces,” potentially questioning the framing of this reading response’s topic of “negation and rationalization” as driving forces of racial capitalism. Yet, as she describes “racial ideologies are not free-floating ideas of social difference, but rather political strategies designed to preserve or challenge a specific social division of labor rooted in time and place” (Jones, 614). Thus, Cephas and Trotter’s historical subjects and analysis may not be seen as examples of negation and rationalization within racial capitalism, but rather as evolutions and strategies of negation and rationalization within their own historical moments. Here, racial capitalism can be seen as an expansive, integrative lens which can read across time and space, uniting social and economic phenomena under systems of wage labor. </p>
