			<h3 style="font-family:CMU serif;">Working (Class) Bodies</h3>
			<p>In his 1934 essay, “Techniques of the Body,” French sociologist/anthropologist Marcell Mauss argues that human bodies are conditioned by society. In fact, the movement of bodies, their cadence, rhythm, relative strength, and abilities to conform to different shapes and patterns become the basis for identifying traits associated with a range of social categories: American or French, male or female, and adult or child. According to Mauss, “In group life as a whole, there is a kind of education of movements in close order.” That is, as collectives of bodies, we learn to move and act in certain ways that reflect our place within the specific social order, which is particular to a national context. For Mauss, bodies correspond to categories of the social scientist, thus they display the range captured by statistics, revealing the specific frames through which the sociologist or anthropologist is able to conceive of social behavior in the 1930s. What Mauss leaves out is that each of these categories is, by definition, flawed. A national body leaves out regional difference. A male or female body leaves out nonbinary or gender non-conforming bodies. An adult or child body leaves out an adolescent body. While these categories have clearly multiplied and been treated with increased nuance in the nearly 90 years since Mauss’s article, thinking though the body can and should be done in dialectical terms. </p>

			<p>On the other hand, Jessica Kuskey understands that the “abstract body” of the worker is produced by the machinery of industrial capitalist production. In producing this generalized notion of a body, capitalism both swallows it up and also gives workers a rallying cry for improvements. In creating the machinery to efficiently produce unfathomable quantities of commodities—by fueling progress—capitalism both creates the conditions for the mangling of bodies, but also for a new kind of previously unimaginable repair. A metal stamping machine might mangle the finger, but the surgeon can fix it (only to send the worker back to the factory floor). Furthermore, the creation of the “working body” gives laborers the ability to demand protections for this body, shorter working hours, weekends for the body’s repose, etc. Yet, as Ava Baron and Eileen Boris argue in their essay, “’The Body’ as a Useful Category for Working-Class History,” it is exactly this Western concept of the body that has also served to privilege white male bodies over those of everyone else, with non-white, non-male bodies, and disabled bodies marginalized.</p> 

			<p>Thus, “bodies have served as the terrain to reproduce gender, race, and class hierarchies.” (43) This is certainly the case for Edward Slavikash, whose case studies on Pittsburgh reveal the way in which the body of the worker in an early-twentieth-century industrial city was often a tool for male workers and capitalists to conspire to reduce the amount of power women and immigrants, for example, had in society. Thus, the body is both produced by capitalism and an object for social movements and scholars alike. All of the week’s readings underscore how important it is to question labor histories’ own blind spots in overemphasizing the same white male body as the rallying cry for struggle and scholarship.

			<h3 style="font-family:CMU serif;">Racialized Labor</h3>
			<p>What is the function of race within the history of capitalism and how have racial ideologies inflected the labor histories that are the focus of our research? Each of this week’s authors has a slightly different take on this question, though there are some strong overlaps. In terms of periodicity, we can separate Robinson’s Black Marxism from Roediger, Trotter, Cephas, and Jones; Robinson’s sweeping, synthetic history begins with a reinterpretation of the history of capitalism in Europe that begins much earlier than the others. Starting with the fall of the Roman Empire and the deurbanization of Europe, the eventual rise of banking centers in Italian city-states, and finally the expansion westward that led to the colonization of the Americas, Robinson reframes the development of capitalism in terms of “antagonistic relationships” (race, ethnicity, tribe, language, etc.) (10). These antagonistic relationships—largely the presence of slaves in Europe long before the advent of the transatlantic slave trade and European colonialism in the Americas—are evidence that the control of various forms of labor has always been nurtured by conflicts that go beyond a simple class distinction, but ones that are geographic, ethnic, linguistic, and racial. For the other authors, the story largely begins in colonial North America, though given their shared goals of troubling the simple white/Black or free(d)/enslaved binaries they emphasize the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as times in which the relationship between slavery and Blackness had not yet crystallized, as was the case in the nineteenth century and even after the Civil War (or even to this day, in a popular historical imaginary of US history that tends to begin around the Civil War). 
			</p>
			<p>To what degree do the authors decouple Blackness (or a stable concept of race) from notions of freedom and enslavement? Roediger works backward from the notion that whiteness and “the worker” are often linked in US culture to argue that during colonial times “racial lines were often drawn quite waveringly at the bottom of society.” Yet, with political independence from Britain “freedom” took on a multivalent meaning and its opposite became slavery. While his argument doesn’t strictly state that this political development was the cause of the eventual disenfranchisement of previously skilled Black artisans, for example, he does state that solidarity was more difficult and labor as such became associated with whiteness. Jacqueline Jones similarly wishes to trouble the same binary, arguing that racial ideology serves to “preserve or challenge a specific social division of labor rooted in time and place.” Yet, they were never fixed, were opportunistically employed, and changed over time. She prefers to view the lower echelons of society together and even look beyond the South as a contained geographic unit for historical analysis seeing parallels and comparisons between degrees of subjugation across multiple geographies. Cephas is concerned with the legacy of slavery and its continuum with incarcerated laborers in chain gangs, he is ultimately concerned with a question that plagues anyone interested in the industrialization of the built environment: how to account for the use of seemingly feudal or anachronistic forms of labor (like slavery) for modernizing processes linked to industrialization? Trotter also takes on this question positing that the skills of enslaved Africans and their decedents were essential for the construction of early colonial American cities, yet the power and (relative) privilege afforded by artisan status was gradually eroded by the growth of European immigrants. While Jones bemoans the “zero-sum game” of white–black labor dichotomy, Trotter lays it out as a basic fact of how Black labor was weakened.
