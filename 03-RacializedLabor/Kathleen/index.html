				One of the major threads connecting the readings for this week is their unpicking of what has been characterised as ‘ontological’, ‘determined’, ‘natural’ (the definitions, taxonomies and binaries of Black/white labour and Black/white workers) such that it is exposed as rationalised, contextualised and, therefore, constructed.  </p>

				Cedric Robinson’s chapter pivots on the undoing of Marxist (and Hegelian) historical determinism. Robinson argues against the understanding of the bourgeoisie (and, with it, the racialisation of labour) as a discrete historical phenomenon to be understood in terms of dialectical thesis/antithesis/synthesis. One of the crucial contributions of Robinson’s chapter is that he re-evaluates and opposes the Hegelian philosophy of history which underscores Marxism, thereby demonstrating that Marxism has, in fact, shared in the same weakness as the capitalism that it opposes (the assumption of economic rationalism). Thus, Robinson undercuts, firstly, the Hegelian prejudice that history is to be realised in the Germanic world (and that civilisations such as those found in China and India are ‘outside history’), and, secondly, the Marxist prejudice that, though communism should be transnational, some countries are better suited to its realisation than others. History, as conceived of by Robinson, is contingent and it is a continuum: the bourgeoisie and racialism predate capitalism, and lie, in fact, at the roots of European ‘civilisation’. Across European history, Robinson suggests, there have been a number of context-bound iterations of the bourgeoisie, in the same way, that labour has consistently been racialised in different ways at different points in time. As a result of the fact that two of its defining components are not of its own making and, instead, ‘particularistic’, capitalists can never achieve the coherence, or the objectivity promised by capitalism itself. Similarly, however, these same components may defy ready analysis and even comprehensive subversion through revolutionary projects. Ultimately, Robinson’s critique of the normative dimensions of Marx and Hegel as sharing the normative function of the ‘bourgeois phantom representation’ leads him to undermine the ‘force of historical inevitability’ as being assumed through a ‘language of error’. This enables a number of revelations: 1) the character of capitalism is contingent on European civilisation and not vice versa; 2) slave labour persists in Europe from Antiquity; 3) the bourgeoisie and the state apparatus produce self-rationalising myths which nominally promote an egalitarian agenda (from the advent of the city onwards), but are actually the cause of domination; 4) race is a rationalisation for the domination and exploitation demanded by the uneven development of national capitalisms (because of the competitive bourgeoisie). By stepping outside the dialectic, Robinson de-determines history and, thus, de-ontologises the factors at play, such that they cease to function as abstract ‘forces’ and instead reflect and reflect on contingency and contiguousness.</p>

				David Roediger explores the American ‘white worker’ as a historical phenomenon before 1800, exploring the associations of whiteness with the word ‘worker’ as a result of changing ideas about freedom during this time. Roediger proposes that ultimately whiteness began to serve as a kind of defence of the worker’s independence after the American War of Independence, before which when racial delineations among the lower classes had been fairly flexible. After the revolution, the freedom promised to white indentured workers was undergirded by the fact that Black slaves could not access the same freedom. The category of ‘freeman’ came to speak both to a political and an economic status (citizen with means) which was concentrated on labour. Therefore, Roediger argues that the worker is ‘made’ as white by the same token that Black populations were increasingly regarded as enemies to the (white) project of (white freedom). Roediger’s interpretation of this period almost seems to posit a defensive need for the politicians of the day to reify American freedom somehow. It is interesting that Roediger notes that there were almost no slaves in Europe during the period he discusses; if we take Robinson seriously, then we might argue that the emergent capitalism did not eliminate the slavery inherited from Antiquity but just relocated it. Certainly, the relative historical proximity of the (Euro-)Americans to Europe during this time begs the question as to how easy it is to separate the ‘civilisational’ habits of the two.

				Joe Trotter presents not just a taxonomy of Black labour, but also how antebellum legislature produced by white elites and exacerbated by the growing hostility of the white lower orders, racialised certain kinds of labour as ‘Black’. In turn, Black labour, then, served to produce the new world order within which its action was restricted. This paradox is felt, in particular, in the example of the preindustrial city; free and enslaved Black workers created the early urban environments from which they were excluded. On one level, Trotter argues that the origins of the Black working class took place in the face of adversity; on another, we can see that these contextual conditions of increasing adversity are part of what moulds those origins. That the Black working class arises as a construct of Black labouring creation and of white legislative and social constriction seems to corroborate Roediger’s characterisation of the period until 1800, in that Black labour was devalued.

				In Jay Cephas’ article, the act of labour put on public display (in this case, the chain-gangs of early 20th-century Georgia) is understood as creating both the material effects of labour (Georgia’s extensive roads) and images of labour connecting the worker to the work and to the environment in which it takes place. The analysis of how a racialised spatial imaginary is produced unseats the assumptions on which it is based, exposing for us, instead, the ways in which this imaginary serves to rationalise and reinforce the very racialisation of landscape and labour identifiable in the antebellum southern states. Cephas’ attention to how the chain-gangs were staged (where, in which clothes, and to which audiences) highlights the exploitation of labour as the production of a kind of performance. Although, of course, the chain-gangs cannot be interpreted in terms of the wage-labour relation as there was no wage, the performative dimension of the labour does seem to function as a kind of ‘surplus’, in that the chain-gang organisers are able to extract from the men’s labour more than just its immediate material product.

				Jacqueline Jones’ emphasis on the embeddedness of racial ideologies provokes key consideration of the intersections of race, gender, and class. In conjunction with her more global approach to the history of what she discusses (she is not presenting a case-study nor an analysis of a single period), Trotter’s intersectional approach gives her work the greatest relevance to contemporary activism, especially as she raises the issues of racial discrimination in labour unions and feminist movements. While Trotter shares the attention to rationalisation over ontology at work in all these readings, her sense of competing and recurring (or even continued) ideas perhaps aligns her most closely with Robinson’s approach to history.
