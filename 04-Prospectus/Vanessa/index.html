			<p style="font-size: 10px;">"Hydrant: In the Air," 1963 — "It's significant because it shows us. We were not allowed to go to the public pools. So we opened our hydrant and we cooled ourselves off. But when I saw it and photographed it I made it more than just poor people turning on a hydrant. I'm very proud of that image. And it says a lot to my community. Hopefully when you look at my image you don't see poor people." Hiram Maristany/ Smithsonian American Art Museum. </p>

			<p> During the late 1940s and early 1950s thousands of Puerto Ricans migrated to New York City following the implementation of the economic strategy known as Operation Bootstrap in 1944. This strategy aimed to transform Puerto Rico from an agricultural based economy into a manufacturing center for U.S. companies seeking cheap labor.<sup>1</sup> As attempts to convert the island into a manufacturing destination failed, many unemployed workers decided to move to New York City, where they could find low-wage manufacturing and service jobs. These migrants were primarily young families that came from rural communities in the island where subsistence and sugar plantation farming served as life sustaining production means.<sup>2</sup> When they arrived on the United States mainland, their positionality as quasi-colonial subjects inevitably affected their   relationships to labor, capital, and production. This required the adoption of bodily and spatial negotiations in order for life sustaining labor to be accomplished. These negotiations allowed production within a city that was governed by economic and political structures that did not account for these individuals as subjects. </p>
			
			<p> By acknowledging imbalances of power within these spheres and continuously searching for a way forward in the everyday, Puerto Ricans have coined the term la brega, which has emerged as an encompassing word and phrase that allows Puerto Ricans to express a response to the many invisible structures that subjugate daily life. The term la brega has been analyzed by Professor Arcadio Diaz Quinones, who has argued that la brega: “No es una forma de ser. Es una forma de estar y no estar, un tipo no preciso de lucha, una negociación entre la ausencia y la presencia.”<sup>3</sup> Quinones’ definition highlights how la brega embodies a dialectical relationship between absence and presence. The body that participates in la brega, compromises actions, economies, and spaces at various scales in order to grapple with the condition of being and not being that defines the subject. </p>
			
			<p> The cyclical nature of la bregadera, blurs the boundaries between labor and regeneration as energy is constantly being exerted since mitigation never fully resolves the totalizing effects of systemic colonial power structures. By constantly negotiating and working to mitigate hardships that never get fully resolved, the subject in la brega produces what Hannah Arendt considers to be “the human artifact, bestow [ed] [as] a  measure of permanence and durability upon the futility of mortal life and the fleeting character of human time.”<sup>4</sup> This research project intends to investigate how forms of architectural labor and work –produced in la brega / bregando–by Puerto Ricans in New York City not only assured survival of the individual, but also ensured a measure of permanence and durability despite conditions of not being.<sup>5</sup> By looking at areas such as El Barrio, the Lower East Side, and Williamsburg, the research will explore how social movements led by groups such as the Young Lords, CHARAS, Los Sures, and artist collectives such as Taller Boricua, formed bregas colectivas that produced significant spatial forms and architectures that challenged quotidian uses of vernacular spaces throughout the city.<sup>6</sup> The spatial forms and architectures produced by these groups will be analyzed as manifestations that proffer distinctions between realms of labor and regeneration. </p>
			
			<p> It is important that the body of research and visualizations of this project do not accentuate celebratory narratives of la brega that champion resiliency in the face of adversity. Rather, this research project proposes a spatial reading and visual mapping of forms and spaces in order to better understand how negotiations of the subject extended to an urban scale, and created changes that allowed these communities to survive in the city. In “Why Read the Young Lords Today,” Iris Morales and Denis Oliver-Velez state that “we were there, and a body of our work remains, mostly unpublished until now, scattered about the country in old trunks, closets, and a few libraries, and on microfilm, waiting patiently to see the light of day, to give testimony to our struggle”.<sup>7</sup> Though contemporary writings and archival projects have expanded the acknowledgment of Puerto Ricans in New York City, much of this work has not connected the relationship between Puerto Rican labor and architecture. In order to bridge this gap, the research will reference the “everydays” that are brought to life by photographs, poems, artworks, and testimonies that are many times ignored. By potentially highlighting how certain spatial forms and architectures that many times were contested sites (ie: casitas, domes, vacant buildings) served as “regenerative” spaces, this research will unveil how negotiations of the subject mobilized radical changes in the built environment. </p>

		<h2 style="color: rgb(221, 44, 47);">Dataset</h4>

			<p> The dataset so far has compiled data on spaces throughout the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Manhattan, that have directly been built or transformed by Puerto Ricans. The coordinates provide the locations for either existing or once existing locales that served as spaces of resistance, community, and/or living. Currently, the data is classified into different spatial types including: casita, dome, gallery, demonstration, center, and building. These types have emerged as prominent architectural sites formed through collective bregas. These sites reflect how the subjects and architects of these spaces were constantly renegotiating dynamics of power and labor, in order to create defined areas where they could regenerate. </p>
