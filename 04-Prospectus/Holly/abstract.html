      On December 6, 1984, a group belonging to the right-wing, anti-communist political party Resistência Nacional Moçambicana (“Mozambican National Resistance” or ReNaMo) attacked a convoy of East German agricultural experts traveling between the city of Lichinga in northwestern Mozambique and rural community of Unango. Eight East Germans, five Mozambicans, and a Yugoslav citizen working in development aid were killed when ReNaMo members opened fire on their minibusses. The attack had immediate repercussions: before the end of the day East Germany had halted its expansive aid program in Mozambique, pulling out its citizens and ending the program’s flagship agricultural and mining development schemes <span title="Ulrich van der Heyden, “Es darf nichts passieren! Entwicklungspolitisches Engagement der DDR in Mosambik zwischen Solidarität und Risiko,” in: Wir haben Spuren hinterlassen! Die DDR in Mosambik. Erlebnisse, Erfahrungen und Erkenntnisse aus drei Jahrzehnten, ed. Matthias Voß. (Münster: LIT Verlag, 2005), pp. 278-313. "><strong>[1]</strong></span>. Curiously, one of ReNaMo’s most enthusiastic and generous supporters was the prominent conservative West German politician Franz Josef Strauss, then the Minister-President of the federal state of Bavaria <span title="See: Tom Young, “The MNR/RENAMO: External and Internal Dynamics,” African Affairs 89:357 (1990) pp. 491-509. "><strong>[2]</strong></span>. </p>
     <p> Given these dynamics, the attack near Unango might be interpreted as the realization of a Cold War fantasy of conspiracy and subterfuge, like the plot of a John le Carre novel or a James Bond film. While this violent encounter demonstrates the geopolitical stakes of Cold War-era foreign aid and development work, it is described here in order to illustrate exactly what did not happen on December 6, 1984: in spite of strained diplomatic relations, the tens of thousands of Mozambican Vertragsarbeiter (“contract workers”) at work in East German factories, farms, and mines were not expelled from the German Democratic Republic (GDR). Beginning with a reciprocal agreement initiated in 1979, East Germany and Mozambique had entered into a bilateral arrangement: the GDR provided significant aid funding, infrastructure development, and training to Mozambican workers, and in return, the African nation (which had gained independence from Portugal in 1975) was to provide significant labor to East German factories, mines, farms, and other industrial sites.  This labor was in turn compensated with an adjustment to account for Mozambique’s debts to the GDR—debts which remained after the attack near Unango, and were subsequently paid down by Mozambican contract workers until the GDR’s dissolution in 1990 <span title="Bill Paton, “Mozambique: Labor Export Policy and International Conflict,” in Labor Export Policy in the Development of Southern Africa (London: Macmillan, 1995) pp. 168-170.  "><strong>[3]</strong></span>.</p>
    <p> This agreement was shaped by the GDR’s rhetoric of solidarity aid: in the sixth article of  its second constitution, adopted in 1968, East Germany codified a “solidarity-driven” mode of foreign policy to liberation struggles and recently postcolonial states <span title=" Hans-Joachin Döring, Es geht um unsere Existenz : die Politik der DDR gegenüber der Dritten Welt am Beispiel von Mosambik und Äthiopien. Berlin: Ch. Links, 1999, p. 37. "><strong>[4]</strong></span>. What remains to be explored in detail are the material and spatial experiences of “solidarity” which emerged through such diplomatic arrangements. My research project looks to map the spaces of labor, life, and leisure of Mozambican Vertragsarbeiter in East Germany, with a specific focus on the years 1984–1990. In addition to diplomatic tensions post-Unango, the period is notable as it marks the final five years of German state socialism, a half-decade of changing political, social, and cultural policies in the GDR. Unlike existing literature on Vertragsarbeiter in the GDR, which has considered the specifics of labor or the political nuances of the bilateral agreements, my study looks to uncover and map space: to document and describe place and space in order to consider the ways in which foreign labor was a simultaneously integral yet largely invisible part of East German daily life in the final years of the GDR.  </p>
    <p> Cedric Robinson’s description of difference, rather than homogenization, as the constituting factor in European civilization and the emergence of capitalism has helped to shape the ways in which I approach this material, as has our discussion of racial capitalism more broadly. As I move to analyze the spatial data I have collected, I will look to the ways in which Mozambican identity in East Germany—an identity shaped by relentless attention to racial difference, as recent scholarship has shown—was reinforced by space. As my preliminary data demonstrates, Mozambicans lived and worked on the periphery of East German communities: from an open pit mine outside of Cottbus to a pulp mill in rural Lengefeld, sites of labor and life for Vertragsarbeiter was spatially distinct from the communities that their labor served. In doing so, I look to begin to “link ideology to material conditions and individuals to structures”: to use this spatial dataset as a way of approaching the exclusionary, extractive techniques of foreign labor in East Germany.</p>
