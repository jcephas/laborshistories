My in-process dataset compiles what I call “spaces of Mozambican experience” in the German Democratic Republic (GDR). These spaces are culled from existing literature on Mozambican Vertragsarbeiter. When I began tentative research for this project, I was struck by the lack of specificity with which prior studies treated the work of Mozambicans in East Germany, let alone their private and personal lives. As such, locating spaces where Mozambicans lived and worked has been the product of close reading, research into the history of industrial sites in East German communities, and some careful image analyses. Often times I have been able to find the name of an East German Kombinat (state-owned industrial enterprises which often administered multiple sites in distinct regions under the same name) and have worked to find its specific location in or near a community given contextual information from my sources.
