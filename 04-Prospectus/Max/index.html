			<p>Six years after overseeing the design and construction of Central Park in New York, Frederick Law Olmsted was appointed “Superintendent or Manager” of the Mariposa Estate, a network of gold mines occupying a ten square mile land grant in central California.<a href="#Reference1"><sup>1</sup></a>  Olmsted was a major historical figure in the mid-19th century United States, responsible for shaping the modern profession of landscape architecture by designing sites such as Central Park and Boston’s Emerald Necklace, and a journalist who published a series of abolitionist texts on Southern agriculture immediately prior to the Civil War. His career in mining is less well-known.<a href="#Reference2"><sup>2</sup></a>  The mid-19th century rapport between landscape architecture and mining illuminated by Olmsted’s work managing Mariposa Estate, I argue, underscores the historical intimacy between land, labor, and value.<a href="#Reference3"><sup>3</sup></a>  <p>While in the present-day, mineral extraction and landscape architecture may seem opposed, the New York businessmen who controlled the Mariposa Company selected Olmsted to run the mines’ day-to-day operations precisely because his competencies managing large-scale land-based projects had clear applicability to mining.<a href="#Reference4"><sup>4</sup></a>  Indeed, the nascent profession of landscape architecture, as Olmsted practiced it in the making of Central Park, was a highly technological endeavor combining design with all the challenges of moving massive amounts of earth. Scholars such as Anne Whiston Spirn, Jane Hutton, and others have commented on the condition by which the naturalistic appearance of Olmsted’s landscapes occludes the human labor that constructed them.<a href="#Reference5"><sup>5</sup></a>  In fact, over the course of building Central Park, Olmsted directly oversaw a 3,000 person labor force to manipulate rocks, sculpt soil, and plant trees.<a href="#Reference6"><sup>6</sup></a>  Olmsted’s expertise organizing workers to transform the earth made him an ideal candidate to manage the gold and silver mining operations at Mariposa Estate.</p>
			<p>To Mariposa’s shareholders, all of whom witnessed the erection of Central Park first-hand, Olmsted’s practice of landscape architecture likely appealed as a somewhat alchemical transformation of space, minerals, vegetation, and water into something new and valuable, much like mining produced expensive and luxurious objects from the ground. The “feverish futurity of gold rush,” to borrow a phrase from historian Manu Karuka, propelled a powerful mythology of financial gains submerged in veins underground, waiting to be realized.<a href="#Reference7"><sup>7</sup></a>  In Civil War era U.S., building large public works entailed the kinds of technological and managerial expertise well-suited to exploit this financial potential of ground.</p>
			<p>Only Mariposa’s workers stood in the way of the company’s executives – and Olmsted – from cashing in on the metals lying in waiting beneath the ground. When Olmsted arrived at Mariposa Estate, he soon decided that the mine workers’ wages were too high, so he slashed pay and began hiring Chinese laborers at $1.75 per day, about a dollar less than white workers were paid. Miners then organized a strike, which Olmsted eventually terminated by sending sheriffs after the action’s organizers.<a href="#Reference8"><sup>8</sup></a>  Throughout Olmsted’s tenure at Mariposa Estate, his writings and correspondence show him applying his longstanding concern with the links between social conduct and the built environment to the new landscape of California. In the Law and History Review article, “Olmsted’s Police,” David Thacher describes Olmsted’s installation of a Central Park police force based on a philosophy of policing that sought to regulate the decorum of urban masses to prevent more serious injuries from eventually occurring.<a href="#Reference9"><sup>9</sup></a> At Mariposa, Olmsted projected this understanding of urban parks as spaces for social ordering onto the much larger scale of the arid landscape of the American West. Under his management, Olmsted hoped to make the West “civilized.”<a href="#Reference10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
			<p>Olmsted remained in charge of Mariposa Estate between 1863 and 1865, during which time he ingratiated himself with the leaders of San Francisco businesses like banks, shippers, telegraph companies, canal building firms, and oil prospectors – the kinds of firms that would soon profit from settler expansionism.<a href="#Reference11"><sup>11</sup></a> Olmsted himself invested in these firms while also managing other New York elites’ investments in California infrastructure.<a href="#Reference12"><sup>12</sup></a>
