<h1>Playing Prosumers</h1>
<h2>The Design and Labor of Gamification</h2>
    <h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
In the 19th century, the capitalist separated the laborer from the means of production as a way to prosper personally without directly working. By retaining the tools and purchasing the labor, the capitalist profited from the gap between a day’s salary and a day’s work. But this is old news, and the most successful companies of the 21st century have taken this a step farther. While large media conglomerates employ an ever-fluctuating number of laborers to develop and maintain their products, the content of the product is produced not by the capitalist nor their hired labor. It instead transforms the consumer into a producer—a ‘prosumer’—of content within the company’s product. The product is a platform, further separating those who labor from the commodity-value they produce. Similar to Tom Sawyer’s fence-painting lessons, the capitalist now sells an empty product that the consumer fills with their own labor (or else consumes the often free labor of others on the platform). The capitalist incentivizes this labor by gamifying it, obfuscating the toil of the populating the platform behind dopamine-delivering mechanisms, rendering it as play instead of work.
</p>
<p>
Play is as fundamental to the human condition as work is. In fact, play precedes work as children from cultures across the globe exhibit various forms of play long before the necessity of labor takes over in adulthood. As such, play is often opposed to work as a form of activity which produces nothing beyond the momentary delight or development of the player, which itself can be seen as a form of social reproduction. As such in the eyes of the capitalist, play enables laborers to labor more. Furthermore, play does not necessarily exclude behaviors that are also labor. Games are often used to ameliorate arduous tasks. Creating a friendly competition among laborers where the amount of work completed transfers into an arbitrary point system at once adds amusement to an otherwise banal task, and exploits the competitive drive of some laborers so that they work more at no fiscal cost to the capitalist.
</p>
<p>
Through platforms, play has become an increasingly accessible employment opportunity. While professional athletics have long allowed people to play as their job, the rise of streaming and professional gaming has democratized and expanded the realm of professional playing. In these cases, play is the literal work being done, which in turn transforms the relationship the player has with their playing from one of having fun into one of performing. The role of performance—both in terms of efficiency and entertainment—serves as a spectral link between play and labor.
</p>
<p>
This project delves into the complex relationship between labor and play through three interrelated avenues centered around the digital age of the platform. The first avenue looks at websites that produce content with little to no input from their owner. Sites like YouTube and Twitter produce weeks of content everyday from crowdsourced labor. In some cases the prosumers are compensated (e.g. YouTube) while in others they must pay to use the platform (e.g. Twitter under Elon Musk). The second avenue looks at software products and subscription services, which include both professional programs and video games. These applications, like the platform websites, are a product of labor that engenders additional labor from their users whether it be productive (e.g. building houses in Revit) or leisurely (e.g. building houses in Minecraft). The third avenue looks at the physical office spaces of the companies producing these websites and software. In these cases, the work environment is often softened to create a playful place where laborers can blur the line between work and life
</p>
    <h3>Datasets</h3>
<p>
    The sources for each type of data (websites, software, and offices) vary. Website traffic data is publicly available from sites like <a href="semrush.com">semrush.com</a> and <a href="similarweb.com">similarweb.com</a>. Many of these websites also provide data on their operations, such as the number of total registered users, the number of active users and content creators, and the amount of content uploaded daily. Data on software is less readily available. While sales figures for video games are generally made publicly available through consumer reports and advertising, software companies such as AutoDesk and Adobe do not share specific figures with the general public. Furthermore, as both Adobe and AutoDesk use subscription models (the former of which includes all Adobe products), quantifying their use is further obscured. Finally, data on offices has been sourced and scraped from a variety of architectural publications such as <a href="dezeen.com">dezeen.com</a>, <a href="designboom.com">designboom.com</a>, and <a href="archdaily.com">archdaily.com</a>.
