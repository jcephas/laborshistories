    <p class="justified">The last article from the Treaty of Amritsar, written in 1846, offers a gift:
        <br>
        <br> 
        "Maharajah Gulab Singh acknowledges the supremacy of the British Government and will in token of such supremacy present annually to the British Government one horse, twelve shawl goats of approved breed (six male and six female) and three pairs of Cashmere shawls."
        <br>
        <br>
        Signed between the British East India Company and Maharaja Gulab Singh, the contract that ushered the Doghra’s rule over the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir drew lines across mountains and valleys, priced its territories, and subjected its people to a severance from autonomy. What few archives exist from this exchange reveal the critical role the production of kashmir goods played in producing a colonial interest in the valley of Kashmir. Prior to its conquest, the geographic terrain of the valley rendered Kashmir a self-sustaining collection of villages built upon an agrarian economic system. As such, the origins of shawl weaving in Kashmir began as a non-commodified domestic practice. Following the Mughal conquests of the 16th century, the onset of urbanization brought shawl weaving out of the homes and into the factories, known as <i>karkhanas</i>. What began as a vernacular and indigenous craft that honored heritage quickly transformed into a symbol of multiple empires at the cost of its workers’ autonomy. Wherever resistance emerged amongst the weave workers, known as <i>shaalbafs</i>, colonial legislation swiftly stifled revolutionary effort.
        <br>
        <br>
        Focusing on the interplay between 19th century shaalbaf labor practices in Srinagar and the colonial literature which contributed to the exploitation of those practices, the project situates its analysis within the space where borderlands, laws, language, and labor intersect. How did resistance emerge amongst the shaalbafs, and how did they confront the legislative transformations through which the Kashmiri people were subjected to indentured labor exploitation as their homelands dissolved into contested borderlands? Little evidence exists in documenting the spatial conditions of both 19th century Kashmiri karkhanas and the peripheral hamlets in which the shaalbafs lived. Instead, the paper focuses its scope on the 1865 Zaldagar uprising as the event which links labor resistance in shawl weaving to the legal and narrative formations that produced colonial interest and refashioned Kashmir into a borderland. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The project tells the story of Zaldagar as a found poem of primary sources (similar to the work of Tracy K. Smith and Charles Reznikoff). Travel accounts, legal documents, hagiographies, <i>tarikhs</i>, treaties, etc. will be presented as a redaction of words that weave together a story of stifled revolution that has never been acknowledged by the British nor Indian sovereignties. Users will be able to click on the documents and view the content in its entirety to understand how this relationship between labor and law and the schism between homeland and borderland is hidden in plain sight. The documents and narrative accounts emerging from Sikh, Persian, Kashmiri, and European writers during this period render Kashmir’s status as an occupied borderland inseparable from its transformation of the shaalbafs into labor capital. The effect of the found poem, a process of redaction, further establishes these violences as historically silenced. What is made evident in the space between silence leaves a mark on the land, and its material trace resides within the language of legislative documents, narratives, and written accounts. In its attempt, the project unravels the line that threads together borderlands, legislation, labor production, and anti-colonial revolution, revealing in its wake the violence of archival silence.</p>
