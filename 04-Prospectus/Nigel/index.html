    		<div id="abstract-text"> 
				Architectural designers have a particular dual relationship to labor: on one hand, architects are laborers, working to produce designs, drawings, and buildings for clients ; on the other hand, through their design products of their labor, they utilize and instrumentalize the labor of others  as they create and describe the conditions and spaces of labor  for a myriad of workers–construction workers, building maintenance workers, consultants, building inhabitants, and many others. 
				<br><br>
				Attention to each of these poles of labor has seen a marked increase, as interest in conceptualizing architectural designers’ role as laborers has increased in the United States in recent years and the intersections of space and labor histories has been a growing sub-discipline of architectural history in the past few decades. Evidenced by a heavily publicized (though ultimately failed) unionization campaign at New York City’s SHoP Architects, the recognition of the first private-sector architectural union at Bernheimer Architecture , and growing programming of platforms such as the Architecture Lobby, Failed Architecture, and Citygroup, a political movement is currently coalescing around architects’ status as laborers. Simultaneously, the conditions of labor as described in the built environment hasve been a growing disciplinary subject within architectural history for the past few decades with scholars such as Meredith TenHoor and Sarah Lynn Lopez each interrogating the intersections between the built environment and laboring bodies. 
				<br><br>
				This project investigates the affinities, relationships, and correlations between architects’ roles as laborers and their roles as those who prescribe the labor of other, hoping to find connections between both sides of architectural designers’ relationship to labor. How does recognition of architects as workers through labor laws and unions affect the spaces of labor which they design? When architects are acknowledged as laborers, how do they begin to acknowledge the laborers they impact?  By reading the discourses on architects as laborers—the legal processes and structures of architectural unions, the economics of architects’ wages, benefits, and rights—against the representations of construction and maintenance in architectural works in the UK and Sweden, this project aims to understand architects at the nexus of labor concerns. 
				<br><br>
				While the UK labor movement is considered the world’s oldest, a movement towards architectural unionization has only gained mainstream attention within the discipline in recent years with the founding of trade union United Voices of the World–Section of Architectural Workers (UVW-SAW) in 2019 representing a professional shift within the nation. Thus, architectural designers in the UK exist within a historically labor-sensitive social and legal context without the benefits of belonging to robust collective unions. On the other hand Swedish Architecture’s national organization and equivalent to the AIA or RIBA, Sveriges Arkitekter (Swedish Association of Architects), is structured as a collective trade union itself, lobbying for architectural workers’ rights in Swedish government.  What are the economic and legal realities of the experience of architectural laborer which arise from such this difference? How is labor in turn represented and conditioned within the built environment? This project will consider the discourse around architectural labor in the UK and Sweden since 2002, the founding date of Sveriges Arkitekter,  and survey the representations of construction and maintenance laborers in architectural projects during this time period .
