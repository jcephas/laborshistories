	 	</div>

	 		<p>Surveillance practices as they have appeared through architectural and spatial intervention have a long history in the United States. Chattel slavery during the antebellum period in the U.S. served as the driving force for the implementation of some of these characteristics in the design of plantation landscapes. The clustering of the enslaved laborers’ living quarters, slave cabins, and the close proximity of the owner’s quarters created both explicit and implicit forms of surveillance, as the overseer’s watchful gaze could be uninterrupted while their house served as a symbol of their omnipotent power. As described in Mabel O. Wilson’s essay “Notes on the Virginia Capitol: Nation, Race, and Slavery in Jefferson’s America,” Thomas Jefferson’s plantation, Monticello, serves as prime example of the execution of formal, architectural logics that allow for this labor to be visible to the entities in power, while the enslaved labor remained hidden, embedded in the property’s hill and the structure’s expansive terraces (Wilson). This type of surveillance and its manifestation of racialized subjects as property during the establishment of of the U.S. economy through chattel slavery created the notion that these laborers needed to be watched as they both produced and were embodiments of capital.</p>
			
			<p>Today, these mechanisms of control have evolved and reappear in various exclusionary practices through the use of technology, zoning laws, and design interventions at the urban scale. In predominantly Black cities, the traces of segregation can be read at an aerial view; grocery store and bank locations, public transit routes, and one-way street outlets often follow the patterns defined by redlining policies of the 1930s (Brown 2018). Similarly, as understood through the context of the plantation, both public and private spaces in neighborhoods characterized by factors of hypersegregation show patterns of being over policed, resulting in the disproportionate surveillance practices enacted on Black communities. Scholars such as Simone Browne (2015) and Ruha Benjamin (2019) have researched the effects of surveillance on Black workers with importance placed on the understanding that the surveillance of Black labor has been a key feature of capitalism in the U.S. and has reproduced these dynamics not only through the disciplining and controlling of Black workers, but also as surveillance technologies (ie. AI, CCTV, etc.) (re)produce knowledge and information about Black bodies. Just as places can hold racial identities by virtue of their histories of discriminatory practices that inform how those who live in these locations are perceived, these technologies (that frequently appear in these locations) can also inform the construction of racialized subjects (Schindler 2015).</p>
			<p>As the effects of surveillance echo throughout history, Black communities continue to be further marginalized as these practices reinforce their (re)creation as Black racial subjects, seen first as bodies requiring control. With many of these technologies having spatial characteristics and being embedded within the built environment, this project looks to analyze these surveillance methods as they have historically manifested from the plantation to predominantly Black cities using Baltimore, MD as a case study, further highlighting the totality of their gaze upon locations of both Black everyday-life and labor. This project will analyze surveillance infrastructure traditionally designed into the build environment at both the symbolic and explicit level and compare their presence with that of modern surveillance technology and their prevalence in Baltimore.</p>

				<h3>Dataset</h3>
			</div>

				<p>Currently, the collected data has focused on geolocating surveillance technology embedded within Baltimore, MD. The most accessible, public data has been the locations of CCTVs (closed-circuit television), provided by the city government through Open Baltimore. Having already been mapped on their website, the location markers show overlap with parts of the city that have come to be defined by their hypersegregated conditions: the Black Butterfly, a term referencing how the city’s predominantly Black population splays like butterfly wings extending from the city’s core, an L-shape of concentrated resources and most “desirable” real estate. In his book <i>The Black Butterfly: The Harmful Politics of Race and Space in America</i>, Dr. Lawrence T. Brown, a professor at Morgan State University, connects the histories of discriminatory policies and exclusionary practices that created these divides to the current conditions of hypersegregation that the city faces.</p>

				<p>The second set of data collected focused on locations of relatively new technology: ShotStoppers, a system of sensors that detect sounds reflecting gunshots that are located using AI, categorized by human analysts, and then sent to local law enforcement should they meet the criteria. According to published communications between Open Justice Baltimore and the Baltimore Police Department, as of 2021, BPD does not have the sensor location data claiming that it is “confidential,” “owned,” and “maintained” by the company. However, a small set of data had been collected by academic researchers. Upon analysis, it is unclear whether this data indicates the sensors’ locations or simply the AI-generated triangulation of the audio input. The location data strictly included street addresses (no neighborhood or area data) and this information was input into an excel sheet and run through Python to output latitude and longitude data.</p>

				<p>Each full data set includes 600+ rows of information (the latter having been collected from May 2018 to October 2018).</p>
