    		<h1>Digital Artifacts of Labor:</h1>
	<h2>A Critical Examination of the Panama Canal Empmloyment Records</h2>

	</p>
	<h3>
 	<p>This data visualization project will serve as a component of the fifth chapter of my dissertation that focuses on “peopling” as an “infrastructural technique”. While there appears to be well over 15,000 items to process, this project will aim to catalog at least 100 individual employment cards in order to glean a sample of patterns and/or anomalies within the employment records. This project will aim to understand more intimate details about the laborers on the canal project and attempt to identify the kinds of laboring subjects these cards re\produce. It will also seek to address larger questions about labor management practices.</p>

	<p>In line with the rest of my dissertation work, this project will employ and archaeological lens in order to analyze the employment cards for their content as well as their physical status as artifacts. As such the analysis will attempt to reveal the “labors of representation” which connect to the logics, social practices, and strategic decisions called upon to generate a particular representation of the world at this time and place (Voss 2007).</p>

	<h2>Dataset</h2>
	<h3>Tens of thousands of laborers were imported to the American Isthmus for the construction of the canal at Panama and thousands of their employment records have been digitized, indexed, and are accessible via the genealogical platform FamilySearch.org. The employment records cover 1905-1937 and contain a variety of demographic information, detail work titles and labor divisions along with pay rates, transfers, terminations and death. Some also include photographs preserving a partial constructed view of individual workers that can potentially answer questions about clothing, hair style, and whether or not physical attributes correlated with certain types of work or wages. </h3>
