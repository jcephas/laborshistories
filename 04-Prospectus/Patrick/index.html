<div id="text">
	
		<p class=indent>	Since at least the 19th century, furniture made from Southeast Asian forest products have circulated amongst the global elite as indicators of luxury, power, and relaxation. Rattan furniture in the early 20th century saw a surge in interest due to the Western bourgeois obsession with furnishing summer homes; wicker offered a cool and breathable form of furniture that exploded in popularity.<sup>1</sup> Wicker chairs also acted as “photographers’ chairs,” a key addition to photographers’ studios throughout the 20th century.<sup>2</sup> As Stephen Siebert notes in his 2012 book-length study, The Nature and Culture of Rattan: Reflections on Vanishing Life in the Forests of Southeast Asia, the flexible, durable vines of the rattan palm (from the Javanese rotan; taxonomic name calamus rotang) have formed the foundation for a multibillion dollar cane-furniture industry since the 1830s. Narra wood, meanwhile, (also known as “Philippine mahogany”) is one of the hardest woods in the world and thus ideal for interior design; architects from Frank Lloyd Wright to Joseph Eichler have used narra for cabinetry, doors, and furniture. The harvesting, production, and marketing of these forest products have been historically under-researched in academic design scholarship. This is perhaps due to the deep histories of incarceration and colonial oppression at the root of early rattan and narra furniture production, whose largest manufacturing plant in the Philippines was the Bilibid Prison Workshop. </p>

		<p class=indent>	Under American colonial rule, a designer atelier and workshop was instituted in the Philippines’ Bilibid Prison that put incarcerated laborers to work in the production of a significant number of furniture objects made of rattan, narra, and other vines and hardwoods. From this factory of skilled incarcerated craftspeople came a line of designer furniture that was—and still is—coveted by both the Philippine and international elite. The “Bilibid Workshop” became a brand name for the Bureau of Corrections’ (BuCor) perhaps most-well known industrial department—Department D—in Bilibid Prison, a panopticon built by Spanish Royal Decree in 1865 and reorganized to be more “sanitary” and efficient by the American colonial regime by 1901. As part of the American civilizing mission (the “White Man’s Burden”; elsewhere, la mission civilisatrice), the prison system of the Philippines’s organizational and management infrastructure was intended to emphasize to its incarcerated population the sacred importance of labor. BuCor used organizational methods based on a New York Progressive-Era institution, the George Junior Republic, in which children were saved from urban delinquency by a simple and straightforward ideology of work, expressed in their mission: “nothing without work.” The GJR was used as a model for restructuring the Philippines’ Iwahig Penal Colony between 1904 and 1906—during which time a sawmill for processing raw hardwoods was installed—and this labor model of penal reform was imported across the entire Philippine carceral network.</p>

<div id=text>
		<p class=indent> In Bilibid Prison, existing workshops were used as sites for commodity production. The few incarcerated women crafted specialty lace products, while men were put to work in divisions for metalwork and automobile repair, building construction and repair, and both hardwood and rattan/bamboo furniture for sale to the established national and international elite. While BuCor did offer pay for the incarcerated laborers’ work, a majority of the profits remained in BuCor hands thanks to the administration’s sales division, which handled marketing and shipping internationally. The sales division also invited local, national, and international tourists to come and visit the workshop; in a 1916 feature in Vogue Magazine entitled “A Shopping Tour in the Far East,” the author notes that their travel group was “advised to do our shopping at Bilibid Prison,” where they saw “the excellent work of the native prisoners, who are natural hand-craft workers.” The brief episode ends with the sun setting over the American flag, a scene that instilled in the party a distinct pride in “our colonial policy.”<sup>3</sup> Supplanting this evolving policy, Emilio Aguinaldo—the Philippines’ first president, a former revolutionary turned apologist bureaucrat—gifted a narra table to Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1934 that then prominently occupied the lobby of the West Wing (the table was replaced in 1954, when ambassador Carlos P. Romulo gifted Harry S. Truman a new, similarly designed table).<sup>4</sup> Both tables were crafted by incarcerated artisans in the Bilibid Workshop, clearly illustrating both the expansionist American Commonwealth government and the ways in which the “remaindered life” of prisoners—a large number of whom were detained in the midst of anticolonial resistance<sup>5</sup>—whose punishment and reform are, as Neferti X. Tadiar theorizes, simultaneously a “force of production of permanently liquid and liquefiable populations” produced by a “systematic assault on the social reproduction of entire communities…whose lives and life-times can be placed at the disposal of capitalist enterprises.”<sup>6</sup></p>

		<p class=indent>	In this digital research project, I aim to track these modes of furniture production in early configurations of the Philippine prison system, from the harvesting of rattan and narra in the Philippines, to the materials’ processing in the sawmills at the Iwahig Penal Colony and San Ramon Prison and Penal Farm as useable material, to the fabrication of desirable pieces of furniture using incarcerated labor, and ultimately to the furniture’s marketing to national and international buyers.  This interactive project, conceived as a map and database of products, will utilize existing archival materials overlaid and interwoven onto maps of the Philippine carceral network to recover the modes of labor that were politically constructed and physically forced in an American-style (and thus extremely efficient) military carceral regime. I will aim to organize my research and design work into the following sections: 
			<ol>
				<li><b>Source</b>, in which I utilize historical maps and data to articulate the Bureau of Forestry’s management of resources, the prison sawmills processing this raw material in Palawan and Davao, and  Bilibid’s importation of laborers from the archipelago’s prison network made efficient under American rule; 
				<li><b>Work</b>, consisting of narrative descriptions weaving together photographic archival material of incarcerated labor; 
				<li><b>Sales</b>, in which I diagram the managerial and marketing process of developing the Bilibid Workshop’s products into branded and saleable commodities under BuCor director Ramon Victorio (1921–1930);  and finally 
					<li><b>Show</b>, a heterogeneous archive of photographs of furniture made by incarcerated laborers in use by the abovementioned political and pop cultural figures, and of furniture found in auctions online. </ol>
		By illuminating these various modes of commodity production through design and archival work, I aim to draw attention to both the complex history of early 20th century furniture production, as well as the political and economic project of incarceration in a colonized setting.</p>
