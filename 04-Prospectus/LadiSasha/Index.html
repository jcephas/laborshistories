		<h1>Black Spatial Play</h1>
		<h2>Arc 550 _ Space And Subjectivity: Labor’s Histories</h2>
		<h2>Research Prospectus</h2>
		
		<h3>// Abstract</h3>

		<p>Black Spatial Play explores architectural strategies of play and performance across the southern region of the United States, beginning in the post-Civil War period through the early twentieth century.</p>

		<p>The project’s title is a conjoining of the key terms framing the larger aims of this body of work. Black signals a particular subjective identification and that is the communities of Black Americans that are at the center of this architectural history. It is their cultural production toward building practice and convening that shape this historiographical work. Play and performance are conceptualized within this project as the social modalities of gathering around leisure, pleasure, games, and entertainment through sites like the theater, card club, pool hall, and dance venue. Focusing on the spatial conditions of play lets us consider the possibility of cultural enactment onto the built environment.</p> 

		<p>Research components on the topic of play include tracing the history of popular games, the domesticity of leisure, and public convenings of organized play during this period to understand how these modes of Black gathering may relate to the structures and associated communities. Another historiographical approach involves mapping these sites of play alongside the growth of Black enclaves and townships. Exploring these structures through the lens of Black community development is a method to recover a reading of the cultural, political and social sensibilities around the built environment.</p>

		<p>There are a few outputs that will naturally stem from an organization of the project’s research methods, which include an investigation of: one, indices and bibliographic texts produced around the turn of the twentieth century; two, Black southern periodicals, broadsides, programs and organizational papers; and three, city, state and municipal maps, deeds and insurance records. The screen-based environment will present a mapping of this early history of  self-built cultural spaces, including an index of the card clubs and theater houses that were initiated and active, alongside visualizations of data-maps on the Black enclaves and communities that began to spread across the South.</p>

		<p>Overall, this research hopes to address the question, what do these sites of play signify around the sociality of Black spatial thought and practice? As well as glean what is being produced in the pursuit of building toward Black play at the precipice of freedom, citizenship, and land access.</p>

		<h3>// Data Set</h3>
		<p>At this stage, the project’s dataset for this course will illustrate the prevalent theater culture in the South, with a focus on the theater buildings that were opened and active between 1860 through 1920. Collecting evidence of theaters that were both owned and operated by Black Americans in the following states: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. This dataset does not include theaters that were only maintained Black management, nor does it include sites that merely catered to Black audiences or Jim Crow audience structures. The sources that are contributing to the assembly of these theater sites are research collections like bibliographies and indices, alongside Black newspapers, dissertations, and historic registries and commissions. Zeroing in on theater at this early stage of this larger research project provides insights on the histories of Black letters and performance, in addition to architectural history of public business spaces.</p>
