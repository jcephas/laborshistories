		<h4>Research Prospectus</h4>
		
		<p>Black Spatial Play explores constructions of Black spatial practice around play and performance across the southern region of the United States. Identifying and surveying sites for card clubs and theater houses that were active post-Civil War and into the early twentieth century, with the aim shifting the historiography of these structures as illustrations of Black formalism. This topic requires developing a larger handle on the conditions and cultures of collective play during this time period. Peripherally tracing the history of popular games, the domesticity of leisure, and public convenings of organized play. Alongside examining the histories of Black land use and building culture prior to 1865, up to the second-wave of the Great Migration.</p>

		<p>There are two intersecting projects within this body of research. One takes a historiographical approach, involving a mapping of these sites of play alongside the growth of Black enclaves and townships. Looking through the lens of Black community development is a method to recover a reading of the cultural, political and social sensibilities around the built environment. The other project is a theoretical construction of Black formalism in relation to architecture. Using the historical mapping of sites and places to define Black formalism through spaces of use (practice and program), space of interiority (subjectivity, and worldbuilding), and space of form (types, material, and environment). Conceptually asserting a reading of read Black space as Black form into both the absence of a “Black architecture” and the void of the vernacular.</p> 

		<p>There are a few outputs that will naturally stem from an organization of the project’s archival research methods, which include an investigation of: one, indices and bibliographic texts produced around the turn of the twentieth century; two, Black southern periodicals, broadsides, programs and organizational papers; and three, city, state and municipal maps, deeds and insurance records. The screen-based environment will present a mapping of this early history of  self-built cultural spaces, including an index of the card clubs and theater houses that were initiated and active, alongside visualizations of data-maps on the Black enclaves and communities that began to spread across the South.</p>

		<p>These datasets and illustrations support the theoretical construction of Black form as they cull together an understanding of how Black communal spaces are aesthetically, economically and culturally modulated during this time. In addition to addressing the following questions around the cultural production of these architectural strategies. What can these sites of play signify around the sociality of Black spatial thought and practice? What social and political conditions shaped these building practices, from material to environmental circumstances like building underground and building through temporal constraints or fragility? What of the emergent aesthetics that permeate Black spacemaking and placekeeping? What is the relationship between Black formalism and play, and how do they respond to questions of subjectivity and interiority? Overall, this research hopes to glean what is being produced in the pursuit of building toward Black play at the precipice of freedom, citizenship, and land access.</p>
