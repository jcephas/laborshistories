 This week, I found the Kohr reading to be most compelling in its relationship to my own work. The under-documented, or even un-documented, histories of Chinese transcontinental railroad laborers is interesting to me in the relationship to the number of photographs produced along with how much this group of laborers was placed in a subject position for the labor that they produced. For me, this visual documentation of bodies of laborers parallels my project in the visual documentation of the women rice workers that lacks any solidified references for who these people were. Khor raises a good point in that, “…the digital archive is a touchstone for larger questions of history and memory”, along with the premise that’ “…photographs reveal not only the potential and limits of photography as a historical source, but the potential and limits of all historical sources and historical inquiry as an intellectual project.” (p.432). In working with visual objects of historical evidence there is a different use of playing with or uncovering the subject outside of their labor due to the fact that the majority of information extraction comes at face value. 

This ties in with Doss’s article on the specific representation of laborers during the Great Depression. Due to certain cultural phenomena and trends, the particular ways in which laborers, and more specifically diverse sets of laborers based on race, gender, and cultural background, have been represented is drastically different. In the creation of my archive, it is my goal to recognize the conditions in which the illustrations and photographs that I am working with were taken and then dissect their aesthetic value into various components of their production in context.
