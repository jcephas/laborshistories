	<h2><i>the Philippine Carceral Network</i></h2>
		<p class=indent>In the context of the Philippines between 1902, the founding of the American colonial civil government; and 1935, the founding of the Philippine Commonwealth government, incarceration formed a foundational social institution for the stability of an oppressive and extractive political economy made more efficient under American security. As Alfred W. McCoy articulates, “the Philippines has been the site of a protracted social experiment in the use of police as an instrument of state power. Indeed, America’s ad hoc experiment with colonial policing was mutually transformative, central in both the transformation of the Philippine polity and the formation of the U.S. national security state.”<sup>1</sup> Indeed, as chronicled by Colonel John Roberts White in his 1928 memoir entitled <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/philamer/afj2378.0001.001?view=toc"><i>Bullets and Bolos</i></a>, the Philippine Constabulary’s primary task in the provinces across the archipelago was to pacify communities of anticolonial resistance by any means necessary, whether by murder or incarceration. One of his main targets, his archnemesis Papa Isio, was defined as a criminal under Spanish rule and had, by 1903, established an autonomous, fugitive community in the mountains of Negros Occidental.<sup>2</sup> Similar stories would play across the archipelago for many years to come; incarceration as a colonial and social project would prove crucial to the governance of the incredibly diverse group of communities and landscapes that form the Philippine islands.</p>

<p>While Papa Isio escaped White’s grasp, he was eventually captured and incarcerated in Bilibid Prison in Manila, where a growing population of Filipinos engaged in anticolonial marronage mixed with groups of convicted laborers and unemployed natives in what would become the largest prison in the Pacific. Bilibid Prison, as the main insular prison in the administrative center of Manila, was the center of a vast prison network that mobilized definitions of criminality to maintain social order amidst near constant insurgency in the long Philippine Revolution.  </p>

	<h2><i>the Forest of Products</i></h2>
		<p class=indent>Only a few years prior, the American military government was taking stock of and ordering its newly acquired resources from the Philippine landscape under management bureaus such as the Bureau of Forestry, established in 1900 by the Military Governor under General Order No. 50. Operating as a semi-military organization, the bureau's first director was Captain George P. Ahearn of the 96th U.S. Infantry. By 1909, the Bureau of Forestry had established several state-led operations in forest product harvest, ranging from primary timber products (hardwoods for building and furniture production, including narra [Philippine mahogany], acle, and others); secondary timber products (including dyewood and charcoal); as well as rattan for furniture production. These two categories are depicted by geographical region in the maps below.  </p>

		Harvesting timber involves cutting old-growth forest and processing the wood in sawmills scattered throughout the Philippine islands. Notably, the Philippine carceral network had its own sawmills at Iwahig Penal Colony on Palawan and in San Ramon Prison and Penal Farm in Mindanao. The Bureau of Forestry had additionally, by 1902, established a “mechanical laboratory” in an old building in Manila to test timber for strength, durability, and applications for construction and furniture design. The laboratory was situated on the Pasig River, the main waterway in Manila, allowing for water-borne timber shipments from the provinces to be processed quickly and efficiently. In the bureau’s 1902 annual report, the quality of woods found in the Philippine “virgin” forests were such that processed woods such as narra, tindalo, camagon, ebano, calamansanay, and others would attract “fine-furniture makers.”<sup>3</sup> In the following sections of the report, the potential monetary value of “virgin forest” in the Philippines is emphasized and is of primary concern. This value would, at least in part, be extracted through the prison workshops of Bilibid.

		<p class=indent> In Bilibid Prison, existing workshops were used as sites for commodity production. The few incarcerated women crafted specialty lace products, while men were put to work in divisions for metalwork and automobile repair, building construction and repair, and both hardwood and rattan/bamboo furniture for sale to the established national and international elite. While BuCor did offer pay for the incarcerated laborers’ work, a majority of the profits remained in BuCor hands thanks to the administration’s sales division, which handled marketing and shipping internationally. The sales division also invited local, national, and international tourists to come and visit the workshop; in a 1916 feature in Vogue Magazine entitled “A Shopping Tour in the Far East,” the author notes that their travel group was “advised to do our shopping at Bilibid Prison,” where they saw “the excellent work of the native prisoners, who are natural hand-craft workers.” The brief episode ends with the sun setting over the American flag, a scene that instilled in the party a distinct pride in “our colonial policy.”<sup>3</sup> Supplanting this evolving policy, Emilio Aguinaldo—the Philippines’ first president, a former revolutionary turned apologist bureaucrat—gifted a narra table to Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1934 that then prominently occupied the lobby of the West Wing (the table was replaced in 1954, when ambassador Carlos P. Romulo gifted Harry S. Truman a new, similarly designed table).</p>

<h2><i>Insular Prison Networks</i></h2>
<div id=text>
		<p class=indent>	In this digital research project, I aim to track these modes of furniture production in early configurations of the Philippine prison system, from the harvesting of rattan and narra in the Philippines, to the materials’ processing in the sawmills at the Iwahig Penal Colony and San Ramon Prison and Penal Farm as useable material, to the fabrication of desirable pieces of furniture using incarcerated labor, and ultimately to the furniture’s marketing to national and international buyers.  This interactive project, conceived as a map and database of products, will utilize existing archival materials overlaid and interwoven onto maps of the Philippine carceral network to recover the modes of labor that were politically constructed and physically forced in an American-style (and thus extremely efficient) military carceral regime. I will aim to organize my research and design work into the following sections:
