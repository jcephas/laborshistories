        <h1>Prologue

        <p class="paragraph">
            The last article from the Treaty of Amritsar, written in 1846, offers a gift: </p>

            <p class="tab">
            "Maharajah Gulab Singh acknowledges the supremacy of the British Government and will in token of such supremacy present annually to the British Government one horse, twelve shawl goats of approved breed (six male and six female) and three pairs of Cashmere shawls." <span class="footnote"><sup>1</sup></span>
              <span class="hide">1. “Kashmir: Legal Documents,” January 5, 2009, https://web.archive.org/web/20090105164806/http://www.kashmir-information.com/LegalDocs/TreatyofAmritsar.html.</span>

            <p>
            Signed between the British East India Company and Maharaja Gulab Singh, the contract that ushered the Doghra’s rule over the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir drew lines across mountains and valleys, priced its territories, and subjected its people to a severance from autonomy. What few archives exist from this exchange reveal the critical role the production of silk goods played in producing a colonial interest in the valley of Kashmir. Subjected by law into de facto slavery and prohibited from leaving Kashmir or from performing a different labor, shaalbafs (weave workers) earned on average the equivalent of ¼ of a rupee a day, half of which went back to the State: </p>

            <p class="tab">
            “Those engaged in the art of manufacturing became the condemned sons of the soil and those in positions of power enjoyed limitless privileges. The weavers were despised and spurned while the privileged and fastidious wearers were tremendously respected. Under the perpetual fear of extinction, the former provided the latter all that they needed for their luxury and respectability and earned for themselves nothing but disgrace and stigma clearly reflected in the artisans’ mode of living.”<span class="footnote"><sup>2</sup></span>

            Thus, what began as a vernacular and indigenous craft that honored heritage transformed into a symbol of multiple empires at the cost of its workers’ autonomy. Their body, an instrument in of itself, intrinsically tied to the tools of their labor and a constitution of place-making and identity, labored through sickness and suffering to produce pashm priced by the heavens.<span class="footnote"><sup>3</sup></span>
            <span class="hide">3. Ibid., 64.</span> Wherever resistance emerged amongst the shaalbafs, legislation swiftly stifled revolutionary effort.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">
            Focusing on the interplay between 19th century shaalbaf labor practices in Srinagar and the colonial literature which contributed to the exploitation of those practices, this essay situates its interrogation within the production of space where borderlands, laws, language, and labor intersect. How did resistance emerge amongst the shaalbafs, and how did they confront the legislative transformations through which the Kashmiri people were subjected to indentured labor exploitation as their homelands dissolved into contested borderlands? This project began as a search to uncover the story of the 1865 Zaldagar uprising as the event which links labor resistance in shawl weaving to the legal and narrative formations that produced colonial interest and refashioned Kashmir into a borderland. As such, it belongs to an ongoing journey to read against the grain of institutional archives, instead fashioning new narratives of resistance through catachrestic methods that wrestle with the present-past and the known unknowns. Travel accounts, legal documents, hagiographies, tarikhs, treaties, etc. weave together a story of stifled revolution that has never been explicitly acknowledged by British nor Indian sovereignties. The documents and narrative accounts emerging from Sikh, Persian, Kashmiri, and European writers during this period reveal the ways in which Kashmir’s status as an occupied borderland is rendered inseparable from its transformation of the shaalbafs into labor capital. What is made evident in the space between silence leaves a mark on the land, and its material trace resides within the language of legislative documents, narratives, and written accounts. In its attempt, the project unravels the line that threads together borderlands, legislation, labor production, and anti-colonial revolution, revealing in its wake the evidence hidden within the Archive.
