    First, remember the lakes: Satisar. In the beginning, the demon Jalodbhava was vanquished by the piercing of a mountain which drained the lakes and birthed the valley of Kashmir. Such is the variant myth found within Sanskrit, Persian, and Kashmiri histories. It nourishes Kashmir as a sacred space, and its water, having been touched by gods, is thought to have properties that make its cloth inimitable.
	In contemporary discourse, Kashmir is described either as an embattled borderland territory or as a paradise on Earth. These two definitions jostle Kashmir between extreme scales of time and geography. The dichotomous nature of Kashmir’s spatiotemporality allows its existence to be simultaneously specific and unspecific, as historical, mythical, and everyday time and place coexist within particular narratives and traditions.<span class="footnote"><sup>8</sup></span>
  <span class="hide">8. Chitralekha Zutshi, Kashmir’s Contested Pasts : Narratives, Sacred Geographies and the Historical Imagination, Oxford India paperbacks. (New Delhi, India: Oxford University Press, 2018), 3.</span> In an excerpt from her book Kashmir’s Contested Pasts, author Chitralekha Zutshi writes about the ways in which various written and oral histories and hagiographies would claim ownership over the land of Kashmir by co-opting its past. She argues that placemaking and the evocations of landscape were critical aspects of historical practice and of organizing the temporality and spatiality of Kashmir:
</p>
<p class="tab">
“There is no doubt that the texts discussed here were deeply concerned with the past, and that their authors structured their narratives in such a way that the past sat in judgment over the present and at times over the future. Temporality, thus, was expressed not in terms of a single narrative stream progressing in a linear fashion, but rather as several overlapping streams.  In this ‘hybrid’ or ‘mixed’ temporality, two different types of narrative time come together: historical time (or “the time of great families and kings”) in which political events took place, and sacred time (or “once upon a time”) within which Sufi mystics enacted their miracles. Historical time remained subservient to sacred time, and these two temporal modes frequently coincided to resolve narrative crises with the ultimate purpose of rendering temporal power itself compliant to spiritual authority.”<span class="footnote"><sup>9</sup></span>

As Europe’s presence in Kashmir and Asia at-large increased over the course of the 18th and 19th centuries, literature produced from travelers co-opted Kashmir’s paradisiac image into insidious narratives that encouraged colonial occupation. From the Lalla Rookh poems by Thomas More to the cartographic travel accounts of George Foster or François Bernier to the Home and Lifestyle newsletters edited by Charles Dickens, European writers romanticized through lyric and prose the partly-imagined people and places of Kashmir, sometimes without having ever stepped foot in its soil. In each of these works, the continuous and deeply descriptive presence of the shawl becomes a motif that links the Kashmiri to their labor in the minds of a Western audience, while it simultaneously offers an economic incentive for a sovereign power to take interest in the valley. The travel accounts, in particular, explicitly articulated a need for control of the Kashmiri body by an external power in order to make best use of the land and labor.<span class="footnote"><sup>10</sup></span>
<span class="hide">10. See Bilal Ahmad Parray and Summia Rehman, “On Empire’s Behalf: The Unveiling of Kashmir Valley in the Early Nineteenth-Century Travel Writing,” Journal of Tourism and Cultural Change 18, no. 5 (September 2, 2020), 572–90.</span></p>
<p class="paragraph">
	To reiterate, when weaving is identified within the European’s central imagination of Kashmir, it builds upon the Kashmiri histories that honor heritage and twists it into an economic and geopolitical opportunity for the expansion of empires. Then, to exploit and dismember their bodies means to deny them the ability to perform their work either as labor or as ancestral craft. Thus, with a vacuum of laborers amidst the height of colonial expansion, the British were able to swiftly relocate the means of production into Scotland, as Kashmir’s historic sense of place and identity dissolved.

A note on mapping: the map, too, is a clever craft. 

The map shown reflects on the construction of Kashmir through a Cartesian projection of its rivers and lakes. The contested border of Kashmir is breaking. Have I broken the law?<span class="footnote"><sup>11</sup></span>
<span class="hide">11. Since 1990, it is punishable by imprisonment to produce a map of India and its territories that does not conform to the maps produced by the State. See A.G. Noorani, “Freedom of Expression in Maps,” in <i>CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS AND CITIZENS’ RIGHTS: An Omnibus Comprising Constitutional Questions in India and Citizens’ Rights, Judges and State Accountability</i>, ed. A. G. Noorani (Oxford University Press, 2006), 326–30. </span> And what of the woven-silk maps produced in Kashmir during the 19th century? Do they haunt the present laws that dictate borders and control?
