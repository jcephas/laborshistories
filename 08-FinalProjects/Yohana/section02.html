        <p class="paragraph">
            “Weaving offers too much time for dangerous talk.”<span class="footnote"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="hide">4. Shailja Patel, <i>Migritude</i>, 6.</span> </p>
          
        <p class="paragraph">
          Prior to its conquest, the geographic terrain of the valley rendered Kashmir a self-sustaining collection of villages built upon an agrarian economic system. As such, the origins of shawl weaving in Kashmir began as a non-commodified domestic practice. Following the Mughal conquests of the 16th century, the onset of urbanization brought shawl weaving out of the homes and into the factories, known as <i>karkhanas</i>. Even as various regimes claimed ownership over Kashmir, the State-factory monopoly prevailed. By the time of the Doghra rule, no weaving production could operate without the permission and oversight of the <i>Dog-i-shawl</i> department of excise.<span class="footnote"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="hide">5. For an in-depth explanation on the karkhana system, see  Abdul Ahad, "Chapter 5: Industrial Organization" in <i>Kashmir to Frankfurt: A Study of Arts and Crafts, with a Chapter on the Freedom Struggle of Kashmir</i> (New Delhi, India: Rima Pub. House, 1987).</span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Primary literature from this period suggests the shaalbafs worked in abhorrent conditions: dilapidated factories where dozens cramped into rooms with no ventilation to work on a single loom. If the subaltern cannot speak, what kind of whispered revolution might be found in the space between warp and weft? 
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Indeed, worker uprisings rose to prominence in the 19th century against the worst labor conditions in Kashmir’s known history. How these workers organized is thus far unknown. It would not serve any colonial empire favorably to publish accounts of resistance amongst the Kashmiris; in portraying them as a suppressed herd, the sovereign State can proceed with colonial expansion. Nevertheless, the very existence of laws that barred shaalbafs from leaving the valley or from changing occupation suggests a precedent of warranted behavior. Where else were these behaviors documented? Several secondary sources encountered thus far on the shaalbaf labor conditions of 19th century Kashmir point to a single event from a lone source.

        <p class="paragraph">
          Every secondary account of the 1865 Zaldagar uprising points back to Robert Thorp’s Kashmir Papers. Little  is known of Thorp's life outside of these accounts. Even then, his account of the procession leaves a reader in want of more. If to speak out meant the punishment of the shaalbaf by the State, is Thorp’s word sufficient evidence? Evidence of what? For whom does he (and do I) get to speak? 
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          The punishment for this riot seems explicit enough: drownings, deaths, arrests, mutilations. Mutilation is critically distinct from murder. Mutilation severs the worker’s body from their craft, and from the historical constitution of placemaking and identity that had come to define Kashmir for centuries. Through this severance, the worker cannot perform their work, and a vacuum occurs which then introduces the law as a means to enable an external sovereign presence within Kashmir as well as the impetus to relocate silk production into imitation factories in places like Scotland and France. If, then, the Kashmiris’ home and identity become… a void, a question mark, an absence, unsalvageable… where do they (re)emerge?
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph"> 
          Historians mark the decline of the Kashmiri shawl industry in the same timeframe as labor exploitation and subsequent labor protests increased. Whether it be heavy taxation and mass migration or attributions to European wars and production relocation, scholar Michelle Maskiell argues that the disruption of the Kashmir trade has significantly more to do with narratives and systematic policies crafted by European powers to uphold long-term imperial politics.<span class="footnote"><sup>7</sup></span>
          <span class="hide">7. Michelle Maskielle, “Consuming Kashmir: Shawls and Empires, 1500-2000,” Journal of World History 13, no. 1 (2002), 48-52.</span> Thus, in order to understand the relevance of these labor tensions and the transition from place to borderland in relation to the decline of Kashmir silk production, we must also turn to how Kashmir has been constructed through Eurocentric narrative practices and the problems that emerge when scholars reduce the Kashmiri identity down to their craft.
