        Some <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">concluding</span> thoughts:</p>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Iâ€™m not sure if my intervention produces a poem or if it is just a poetic method that co-opts redaction as a legal process, and what, if at all, is the difference between a poem and a poetic method? The black ink on white space surrounded by black space suggests something is being covered up. The black space is superimposed onto the white page, spatializing the text into the z-axis. What is happening in that space between what was written and what I have covered up versus what is not written and therefore may never be known? As I wrestle with the lack of normative evidence of the Zaldagar massacre, I question what constitutes evidence, and what is it evidence of? Can an intentional misinterpretation of these documents, a catachresis of sorts, allow a new consciousness to emerge? To pose an earlier question in another way: if I cannot speak for the subaltern, what do my methods achieve?</p>
