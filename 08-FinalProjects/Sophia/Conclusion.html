		<p>The uninterrupted gaze of surveillance systems within the built environment has the capacity to reduce Black communities to their subject position as laborers and establishes command of that labor to dictate movement. The first manifestation of racialized subjects as property occurred during the establishment of the U.S. economy through chattel slavery and created the notion that these laborers needed to be watched as they both produced and were embodiments of human capital. The clustering of the enslaved laborers’ living quarters, slave cabins, and the close proximity of the owner’s quarters created both explicit and implicit forms of surveillance, as the overseer’s watchful gaze could be uninterrupted while their house served as a symbol of their omnipotent power. As described in Mabel O. Wilson’s essay “Notes on the Virginia Capitol: Nation, Race, and Slavery in Jefferson’s America,” Thomas Jefferson’s plantation, Monticello, serves as prime example of the execution of formal, architectural logics that allow for this labor to be visible to the entities in power, while the enslaved labor remained hidden, embedded in the property’s hill and the structure’s expansive terraces (Wilson 2020). As the effects of surveillance echo throughout history, Black communities continue to be further marginalized as these practices reinforce their (re)creation as Black racial subjects, seen first as bodies requiring control. With many of these technologies having spatial characteristics and some dwelling within the built environment, these methods have been reemerge from the plantation to predominantly Black cities, further highlighting the totality of their gaze upon locations of both Black everyday-life and labor.</p>

She is interested in surveillance, identity, and spatial politics as they materialize through architecture and the built environment. With a lifelong love for performance and an affinity for the spaces in which they emerge, she hopes to continue exploring the intersection of space, time, and (re)memory through mixed media and spatial practices.<a href="mailto:sophiarose@princeton.edu">Contact Sophia-Rose.</a></p>
