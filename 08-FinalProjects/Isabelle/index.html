          <p>In the early decades of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), hundreds of thousands of young Han Chinese subjects in the eastern regions of China proper were called upon to voluntarily “rusticate” to the peripheral regions of the country.<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup> This state-led program, “up to the mountains, and down to the villages,” (<i>shangshan xiaxiang</i> 上山, 下乡) focused on a distinct category of “educated youth” (<i>zhiqing</i> 之情), a model population of young (aged 16 to 25 <i>sui</i> 岁), urban, and able-bodied individuals targeted by the state for spatial migration. The practice began before the Great Leap Forward (1958–1962), resumed in the early 1960s, and accelerated in 1968 at the end of the Cultural Revolution—and it has since continued in varying degrees.<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup></p>
          <p>In theory, the policy of state-led urban-to-rural migration called for permanent, lifelong resettlement. In other words, it was a state mechanism for moving migrants or settlers, permanently, on to land expropriated from or already inhabited by native and indigenous peoples.<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref">3</a></sup> For young Han settlers, permanency also meant a radical transformation—in their spaces and subjectivities. For the state, it engendered a material solution to “overpopulation,” and it invoked developmental dreams, fueled by socialist potentialities linearly arched towards the modernist progress of Marxist history. In short, the internal settler colonial project situated new landscapes for material commodity production. Yet the material construction and the actual labor of working the “countryside” landscape also produced a new conceptual landscape—a spatial imaginary for reconstituting a new revolutionary class of subjects, through labor animated by the social conditions of the “poor and lower-middle peasants” (<i>pin sha zhong nong</i> 贫下中农).</p>

          <p>In 1976, an editorial published in the <i>Peking Review</i> stated the stakes, simply: “Urban young people with education settling in the countryside is a socialist new thing…and is of great far reaching significance in further consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and gradually narrowing the three major, differences between town and country, between worker and peasant, and between mental and manual labour.”<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref">4</a></sup> This project examines the fraught convergences between these landscapes, identities, and labor, by surfacing the “rusticated” settler bodies working on the reclamation farms of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC) in the northwestern margins of the PRC. The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region constitutes one-sixth of the nation’s total area, and it is the country’s largest political unit, historically bounded by the Soviet Union in the west, the Mongolian People’s Republic in the northwest, and Pakistan, Kashmir, and Tibet in the south.<sup id="fnref5"><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref">5</a></sup> Thus, as a geographical constraint, this research focuses on the historic cotton production and labor of the 8th Agricultural Division of the XPCC in and around the present-day city of Shihezi.</p>
          <p>The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps was established in 1954, in the weeks following the adoption and enactment of the PRC’s first constitution. The military presence in the region was absorbed into this newly formed organization to broadly administer “production and construction.” Demobilized and “rehabilitated” soldiers, exiled and ex-prisoners, and other citizens and migrants (voluntary and involuntary) served as the XPCC’s labor force.<sup id="fnref6"><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref">6</a></sup>  For the Corps, land reclamation was inextricably tied to borderland or frontier defense and stabilization. By definition, the labor of working Xinjiang’s distant and desert landscapes simultaneously meant engaging in militarized defense and protection.<sup id="fnref7"><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref">7</a></sup>  The mechanism that governed working bodies was the reclamation farm, which altered the ways in which labor, personhood, and landscape were triangulated. This system was fueled by the permanent settlement of educated (Han) youth.</p>
          <p>From 1963 to 1966, an estimated 97,000 young Han Chinese subjects rusticated to Xinjiang.<sup id="fnref8"><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref">8</a></sup>  Under this campaign, directed by Wang Zhen, a prominent XPCC founder and leader and head of the National Reclamation Ministry (<i>Guojia Nonken Bu</i> 国家农垦部), Shanghai became a major source of the urban youth absorbed into the Corps. These “frontier-support youth” (<i>zhibian qingnian</i> 支边青年) were given clothes, shoes, food, and train tickets on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang railroad.<sup id="fnref9"><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref">9</a></sup> On this long “journey to the west,” they likely saw, for the first time, a world outside their city homes. Looking outside train windows at framed moving landscapes, their horizons were broadened in new attachments, forged in nationalist feelings for their new socialist motherland.<sup id="fnref10"><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref">10</a></sup> When they arrived, they were given military uniforms. While frontier-support youth were not soldiers, by official accounts, the Corps nonetheless congealed that aesthetic through abstract and synthetic means, dressing the body as a consumable military object.</p>

          <p>Similar to its architectural meaning, rustication also resulted in another kind of artificial surface treatment that was, however, more than mere “dressing.” On the surface, it appeared to turn a soft, urban, raced body into a rough, rural, universal proletarian subject. But through labor, this body was actually transformed: her to-be-used flesh was tempered physically and psychologically, and her personhood was animated, rather than eviscerated, by the aesthetic concealments simultaneously made and unmade by the Corps’ ideological agro-military project. The military reclamation farm staged what the Xinjiang “countryside” meant to these migrants. But in putting them work, the farm not only held that labor; rather, it constitutively shaped the troubled identities and the economic and aesthetic value of the young Han bodies working the Xinjiang landscape.</p>
          <p>In July 1965, Zhou Enlai (second in command under Mao Zedong) visited the young rusticated subjects stationed in the Shihezi Reclamation Area of the 8th Agricultural Division, located in the Manas River Valley of the northern Tarim Basin, some 150 kilometers northwest of Xinjiang’s autonomous capital, Urümqi. “Braving the scorching heat,” the Premier, accompanied by other high officials of the Party, the regional government, and the XPCC, arrived by car. He was driven through a promenade flanked by a “green forest belt” of towering trees to reach the second branch of the Shihezi main field (<i>zhongchang</i> 中场), where a group of educated youth from Shanghai were waiting in anticipation. They belonged to the “sixth-company youth team.” Some managed cotton, some grew wheat and corn, and others worked in orchards and vineyards. They had been rusticated for over a year, arriving on June 10, 1964.<sup id="fnref11"><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref">11</a></sup></p>
          <p>The popular editorial on the visit in the <i>People’s Daily</i> (the official Party newspaper, <i>Renmin Ribao</i> 人民日报) stated that the educated youth of the Shihezi main field had “fallen in love with the farm.” Building the frontier, they had “fallen in love with their second hometowns.”<sup id="fnref12"><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref">12</a></sup></p> In the same article, responding to a question “Are you homesick?” the “youngest girl” of the group, Zhuo Ailing, said: “I don’t want to go home. We are used to everything here. Even if we are told to go back, we won’t go back!” To which Sai Fuding, chairman of the autonomous region, interjected, jokingly: “Then move your home from Shanghai to Xinjiang!”<sup id="fnref13"><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref">13</a></sup></p></p>
          <p>The highly photographed and publicized tour of the Shihezi Reclamation Area was meant to be tangible evidence of a physical and ideological—and thus, socialist—transformation of landscape, labor, and bodies. The young Han body was mobilized under the pretense of proletarian reform, which valorized peasant labor. Settler logics of expropriation were packaged with care, or they were enveloped by a socialist civic duty towards the racialized native and indigenous Uyghur, Kazakh, and Turkic communities inhabiting the ecological “wasteland” of Xinjiang.  In this process, the rusticated body was made doubly “public”: as it was publicized, its work was delimited by the public, socio-environmental mission of the Corps to develop an economic frontier plagued by unruly desert ecologies. Idealizing labor rooted in modern agrarian practices, the XPCC privileged physical, outdoor, farm work; this work linked migrant and settler identities to landscape labor.</p>
          <p>The publicized Han body was racially or ethnically coded as well as gendered. Those who appeared most frequently in photographs, newspapers, and film following the Premier’s tour were female bodies; these young women were “rosy” and, of course, always smiling. Zhuo Ailing, Chen Xueqin, Zheng Yuehua, and Yang Yongqing, for example, were all characterized in this way. The last of the group, Yang, was a Shanghai educated youth, who previously worked as a salesperson and was born to a family of intellectuals. For the Party, this was proof-positive that an individual born into an “exploiting class” might still “wholeheartedly serve the revolutionary cause, [and] constantly transform [her]self through the practice of [her] labor.”<sup id="fnref14"><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref">14</a></sup>Yang would work on the 145th Regiment of the Shihezi Reclamation Area for 14 years and would later become deputy secretary of the Communist Youth League Committee of Xinjiang.<sup id="fnref15"><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref">15</a></sup></p>

          <p>The inclusion of female labor for the production and construction of Xinjiang was modeled as socialist progress. Starry-eyed female farming youths were made into model citizens for the nation; their bodies, perfectly rusticated, were prominently displayed on the Shihezi reclamation farm, a landscape put under the proverbial plough of revolutionary-subject-transformation. State officials were well-aware of the propagandistic merit of this political positioning, as Premier Zhou and Vice Premier Chen said during their 1965 visit: “This [the farm] is a university, a labor university.”<sup id="fnref16"><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref">16</a></sup> While this labor endeavored to radically sublate distinct identities into a unified proletariat, this process of identification sutured a raced and gendered body to the landscape, reinforcing its associations with modern forms of agricultural production, rather than the subsumption of those social conditions. On the XPCC’s 8th Agricultural Division reclamation farms, landscape was more than just the backdrop behind which this identity process experimentally unfolded: it was the means through which differentiated, gendered and racialized labor was produced and constructed. The ideal laboring body was actually a settler Han body; an ideal agricultural landscape was enfleshed in and around it.</p>
          <p>In 1957, “more than 40,000 women” reportedly participated in various tasks of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps. Although published before the 1963-66 concentration of young Han migration into the region, the piece exhibited a relatively early display of female working bodies in Xinjiang, notably on cotton fields. The article boosted that “more than 30,000 women on the agricultural front [have] played a major role in increasing cotton production.”<sup id="fnref17"><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref">17</a></sup></p>
          <p>On the cotton fields of the Shihezi Reclamation Area, productive laborers, perhaps unsurprisingly, were frequently written about in the pages of the <i>People’s Daily</i>. The characterization of ideal labor, however, differed for women and men. For example:
          <br>In 1959, Luo Guizhen, “a short-haired girl,” was named a “heroine” of Shihezi’s white cotton fields. She set a daily cotton-picking record, harvesting “1,511 catties of cotton,” which was more than seven times the amount a person reaps “under normal circumstances.” Her “slender hands [were] like fish swimming in the river, quickly moving among the densely packed cotton plants” with super-human ability and speed.<sup id="fnref18"><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref">18</a></sup>
          <br>In contrast, a column dedicated to “the people who set new records for cotton yields,” centered on the work of Xue Zhanchun’s team on Anjihai Farm.<sup id="fnref19"><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref">19</a></sup> Their cotton planting had set a national record for cotton production per unit area in 1956. This attracted public attention. For instance, the August First Film Studio (<i>Bayi Dianying Zhipianchang</i> 八一电影制片厂), who was shooting film on the high-yield cotton of the Manas River valley for a documentary <i>Army’s Reclamation and battle Song</i> (<i>Junken’Zhange</i> 军垦战歌) later released in 1965, captured Xue’s team at work. The piece highlighted the team’s “comprehensive technical approach” and the “calculation of details” necessary to high-yield cotton production. But in so doing, it implicitly articulated, in male-coded language, a gendered conception of labor: a crucial difference between planting/growing and picking cotton.<sup id="fnref20"><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref">20</a></sup></p>
          <p>While the landscape and labor imaginaries of rustication enabled the Party to conceptually advocate for equal gender relations, the working bodies of Shihezi’s cotton fields gesture to the reproduction of a gendered and spatial division of labor between mental and manual labor, between labor that could be moved indoors and labor outside, and between the technical expertise held by men and the fleshy, corporeal acuity of women. Today, on the cotton fields of Xinjiang, the female, laboring body continues to offer a primary site for both denigration and recuperation.</p>

          <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 16px;font-family: 'Segoe UI', 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;"><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GHpvLBK5HaTbH4mP4d6hmLqjqRgJMOVN5abzX8q_hCA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><b>Go to "Workers" dataset</b></a></p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>While present-day issues around “Xinjiang cotton” are well-documented, its history has been far less examined, particularly in the US. This research launched a historical examination of these cotton fields to carefully redress the mass detention and policing of ethnic populations, largely Uyghur, and the allegations of their forced and slave labor on Xinjiang’s cotton farms today. The political necessity of addressing the structural dimensions of this settler, colonial, and imperial violence and its globalized idioms of power cannot be understated. Nonetheless, Xinjiang’s heightened visibility is often summoned to maintain a US-led global order. The predicaments of this optics of visibility—of what is absented in presence—propelled the larger political project of my research.</p>
          <p>More specifically, this project was fueled by a desire to understand, critically but perhaps differently, the settler logics of Sinification at work in Xinjiang. While the settler colonial framework offers a necessary approach to examining the PRC’s state power, it often reduces the socialist project to only its violences, making legible a Han subject, against whom the “ethnic minority” (<i>shaoshu minzu</i> 少数民族) is pitted. As a labor force, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps was constituted by Han soldiers and settlers, but it also engaged Uyghur, Kazakh, Turkic, Hui, Mongol, and Soviet labor. I was interested in potentially recovering the latter. However, in this study of the 8th Agricultural Division, <i style="color: transparent; text-shadow: 0 0 2px #010057;"><b>these bodies are still missing.</b></i></p>
          <p>Looking through the records of the People’s Daily (from 1952 to 1978), while it was not always clear to me whether or not a given named or unnamed individual, directly or indirectly connected to the 8th Agricultural Division, was an educated youth, their status as a Han settler was often well-defined, whether evinced by their names or other textual clues. Of the individuals I was able to surface from the People’s Daily, all were Han settlers, expect for two people: Ayi Xiamu and Gaoyahan Jilila, who were both Uyghur women. Xiamu, a teacher from Xinjiang Normal University, held and brought both Uyghur and Chinese classes on and to the Shihezi Headquarters Farm; Jilia was a young Uyghur woman who visited the main farm to learn the “advanced farming methods” of the XPCC.<sup id="fnref21"><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref">21</a></sup> These two marginal “exceptions” are perhaps the most important point: their exclusion gestures to an absent body, whose missing life and livelihood, no doubt also tied to landscape, is reflected in historical records. Although the state-led program of resettlement and rustication placed ethnic and racialized bodies within a Han milieu, their named presence and their labor was only conspicuous through absence.</p>

          <p>Although I was unable to access the Chinese Statistical Yearbooks for this study,<sup id="fnref22"><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref">22</a></sup> the lack of native and indigenous testimony and the material erasure and elimination of “ethnic minority” populations in Shihezi are consistent with more recent statistics from the 2000 Census—where northern cities like Urümqi, Karamay, and Shihezi have seen a total domination of Han peoples.<sup id="fnref23"><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref">23</a></sup></p>
          <p>In attempting to explicate the landscape and labor of cotton at the margins of the PRC, what I have found, unsurprisingly, is the Han settler body. Nonetheless, in continuing this work, I hope to hold on to the ordinary violence and everyday conditions embodied in the lives of these working bodies.<sup id="fnref24"><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref">24</a></sup> The revolutionary effect of inter-ethnic relations—publicized and politicized as a socialist practice of <i>another</i> imperialism—was only noticeable in its afterglow, which illuminated the overwhelming presence of rusticated bodies, Han Chinese subjects, who, caught as they were on the fine line of identity and subjectivity, occupied enduring margins between “town and country, between worker and peasant, and between mental and manual labour.”<sup id="fnref25"><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref">24</a></sup> In this tragic but promising condition, suffocated by the lost potentialities of a truly radical project, the cotton fields of the Shihezi Reclamation Area did engender an entirely new model city, a “shining pearl in the Gobi desert.”<sup id="fnref26"><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref">26</a></sup> The laboring bodies of young Han settlers modernized Xinjiang’s frontier landscape, but this happened without a parallel transformation in social relations. On the margins, at the interface between landscape and labor, we are compelled to recover, in the rubble of what is lost, the horizons and limits of a socialist politics of subjectivity.</p>

          <p>In “Historically Remaining Issues,” Bi Xu writes about the living conditions, social life and legacies of the Shanghai zhiqing mobilized in the XPCC. Along the same vein, Michel Bonin writes about the living memory of Maoist rustication in “Restricted, Distorted but Alive: The Memory of the ‘Lost Generation’ of Chinese Educated Youth,” <i>The China Quarterly</i> 227, Special Issue: <i>Red Shadows: Memories and Legacies of the Chinese Cultural Revolution</i>,(September 2016): 775-772. See also Emily Honing and Xiaojian Zhao, <i>Across the Great Divide: The Sent-down Youth Movement in Mao's China, 1968–1980</i> (Cambridge University Press, 2019). The book challenges monolithic state depictions of the participants of the rustication movement. <a href="#fnref24" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>
