This strategy aimed to transform Puerto Rico from an agricultural based economy into a manufacturing center for U.S. companies seeking cheap labor.<sup><a href="Bibliography.html">1</sup></a>As attempts to convert the island into a manufacturing destination failed, many unemployed workers decided to move to New York City, where they could find low-wage manufacturing and service jobs. These migrants were primarily young families that came from rural communities in the island where subsistence and sugar plantation farming served as life sustaining production means.<a href="Bibliography.html"><sup>2</sup></a> When they arrived on the United States mainland, their positionality as quasi-colonial subjects inevitably affected their  relationships to labor, capital, and production. This required the adoption of bodily and spatial negotiations in order for life sustaining labor to be accomplished. These negotiations allowed production within a city that was governed by economic and political structures that did not account for these individuals as subjects.

The term la brega has been analyzed by Professor Arcadio Diaz Quinones, who has argued that la brega: “No es una forma de ser. Es una forma de estar y no estar, un tipo no preciso de lucha, una negociación entre la ausencia y la presencia.” <a href="Bibliography.html"><sup>3</sup></a> Quinones’ definition highlights how la brega embodies a dialectical relationship between absence and presence. The body that participates in la brega, compromises actions, economies, and spaces at various scales in order to grapple with the condition of being and not being that defines the Puerto Rican subject. </h3>

By constantly negotiating and working to mitigate hardships that never get fully resolved, the subject in la brega produces what Hannah Arendt considers to be “the human artifact, bestow [ed] [as] a  measure of permanence and durability upon the futility of mortal life and the fleeting character of human time.” <a href="Bibliography.html"><sup>4</sup></a>This research project intends to investigate how forms of architectural labor and work –produced in la brega / bregando– by Puerto Ricans in New York City not only assured survival of the individual, but also ensured a measure of permanence and durability despite conditions of not being for the community at large. <a href="Bibliography.html"><sup>5</sup></a>By looking at areas such as El Barrio and Lower East Side this research will explore how social movements led by groups such as the Young Lords, CHARAS, and artist collectives, formed bregas colectivas that produced significant spatial forms and architectures that challenged quotidian uses of vernacular spaces throughout the city. <a href="Bibliography.html"><sup>6</sup></a>The spatial forms and architectures produced by these groups will be analyzed as manifestations that proffer distinctions between realms of labor and regeneration.

Bhattacharya highlights the work of Johanna Brenner and Barbara Laslett, which analyzes how this integrated production process involves various kinds of socially necessary work—mental, physical, and emotional—aimed at providing the historically and socially, as well as biologically, defined means for maintaining and reproducing population. <a href="Bibliography.html"><sup>8</sup></a>By employing SRT as a lens through which to observe how la brega embodies an integrated production process that maintains and reproduces a population, it is possible to understand how  negotiations of the Puerto Rican subject extend to an urban scale, creating changes that allowed these communities to survive in the city.</h3>

By highlighting how certain spatial forms and architectures such as casitas, geodesic domes, and demonstrations, served as “regenerative” spaces, this research will unveil how negotiations of the subject mobilized radical changes in the built environment. </h3>
