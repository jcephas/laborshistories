Given the abundance of abandoned open spaces that were destitute as city officials failed to allocate resources responsibly, members of the Puerto Rican community transformed abandoned garages, lots, and industrial zones into social spaces that became zones of regeneration within deteriorating environments. Casitas, or small houses, were defined by their unique wooden structures that stood out from the vernacular brick and concrete high rise city. Elements such as wooden porches, shutters, corrugated roofs, and curated vegetable gardens, not only reflected concerns with economic efficiency, but also emphasized the importance of creating connections with the main island through material specifications. These material connections were strengthened by programs that transformed the casita sites into lively gathering spaces that hosted events such as craftsman workshops, lechón roastings, salsa dance parties, and concerts. By maintaining connections with the main island in an urban context, casita architects maintained their unique subject positions by fostering a complex network of social processes and human relations in light of opposition.<a href="Bibliography.html"><sup>10</sup></a> Joseph Sciorra, a folklorist who has studied the casitas, has highlighted how ''the sad fact is that casitas and community gardens are seen as temporary custodianship of neglected city property, and when the city finds it profitable to develop these properties, they are going to kick these people out.” <a href="Bibliography.html"><sup>11</sup></a>The bureaucratic view of casitas as neglected or illegitimate sites, undermines the essential regenerative nature of casitas and negates the subject position of the architects who built them. Casitas have restored the lives of local people and environments, as they emerged as make-shift spaces produced in la brega that tended to the needs and desires of a disenfranchised working population of the city. By creating “oases ” within dilapidated and peril environments, casita architects produced socially necessary work that allowed local Puerto Rican populations to sustain their livelihoods.  </h3>

	<p style="margin-right: 200px; margin-left: 200px;"> 
	<h3 style="border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 215px;border-right-width: 215px;border-right-style: solid; border-right-color: #000000; border-left-color: #000000; font-size: 14pt; color: white;"> In the early 1970s, six Puerto Rican ex-gang members who started the collective known as CHARAS joined forces with Buckminster Fuller to create geodesic domes throughout lower Manhattan. Aware of the struggles that were associated with la brega and their communities, CHARAS sought to design public interventions that would re-envision alternative ways to occupy space. Given concerns with the poor housing conditions, lack of educational opportunities, and sparse health services within their communities, CHARAS mobilized a network of young community members who wanted to change the status quo. In order to support themselves, many of CHARAS members had previously worked as house painters, electricians, plumbers, carpenters, and general fix-it operators.<a href="Bibliography.html"><sup>13</sup></a>Their construction backgrounds influenced the direction of the collective towards an architecturally inclined line of work. In 1968, the unlikely pairing of CHARAS and Fuller, was aided by both parties' interests in housing and the human condition. The curious group personally reached out to Fuller and to their surprise, sparked a connection. CHARAS’s futurist tendencies that considered the needs of those living outside mainstream society, inspired Fuller, who occasionally met with the collective. Learning from Fuller and his assistant Michael Ben-Eli, CHARAS began to construct geodesic domes as a way to create self-sustaining systems. CHARAS was also able to gain funding for their two major dome projects through support from organizations such as the New York State Council on the Arts and the Vincent Astor Foundation.<a href="Bibliography.html"><sup>14</sup></a> Since their domes primarily occupied large, empty spaces, CHARAS gained traction within the locations they built in. The physical creation of the domes instilled participatory design practices that taught how communal work could produce a reimagined environment by the workers themselves. Even though only two domes were fully realized, the establishment of CHARAS and their projects symbolized the creation, maintenance, and potential of their community.<a href="Bibliography.html"><sup>15</sup></a> The social networks that CHARAS established, proved to restructure the personal lives of its members, who were able to envision alternative futures that did not entail dead ends. </h3>

	<h2 style="margin-right: 200px; margin-left: 200px; font-family:'Fugaz One', cursive; margin-left: 218px; text-align: center; font-size: 20px;"> “After the Garbage Offensive, we trusted our people in El Barrio and they trusted us. They would now support and protect the Young Lords. There was also a practical lesson for all parties involved: when a community stands together and makes a strong statement, it will be heard.”<a href="Bibliography.html"><sup>16</sup></a> -Miguel “Mickey” Melendez </h2>


	<p style="margin-right: 200px; margin-left: 200px;">

Their marginalization, exclusion, and persistent segregation was based on the interaction between the laws and customs that shaped the diverse historical experiences of all non-European-American minorities.” <a href="Bibliography.html"><sup>17</sup></a>  During the 1960s in New York City, chronic unemployment, escalating police surveillance and repression, large-scale displacement of poor city dwellers from housing, public health crisis attributed to poor sanitation services, exponential drug addition, and lead poisoning led to the formation of the New York chapter of the Young Lords organization.<a href="Bibliography.html"><sup>18</sup></a>Primarily composed of young Puerto Rican first generation college educated students, the Young Lords of New York created radical movements that brought immediate changes to their communities. The Young Lords frequently produced  newspapers, graphic arts, poetry, and music that manifested the goals of the organization. These mediums clearly communicated their manifesto, however essential to the mobilization of their movement was the act of protesting and occupying spaces. Working to create structural changes in their communities, the Young Lords organized protests such as the Garbage Offensive, Lincoln Hospital Takeover, First Spanish United Methodist Church Takeover, and X-Ray Truck II Takeover. By coming together, the Young Lords formed bregas colectivas, that radically exposed intolerable living conditions that were enacted by the state. The streets became an important setting for the Young Lords, who used collective publicness as a means to share Puerto Rican struggles with the rest of the city. For example, in the Garbage Offensive, the Young Lords blocked the street roads with trash that was never collected on street corners, and in some cases set the trash on fire, in order to express frustrations about the lack of sanitation services El Barrio received. The Young Lords photographer, Hiriam Maristany, explains how: “we were using the instrument of our protest, which was garbage, to protest even more, meanwhile, the traffic is backing up. Now, it’s O.K. to inconvenience Puerto Ricans and people with no power, but you start to inconvenience people with power.” <a href="Bibliography.html"><sup>19</sup></a> The demonstrations that were led by the Young Lords reflect how the actions of communal based movements repositioned power dynamics between the people and the state in the city.</h3>
