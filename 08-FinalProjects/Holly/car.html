     <p>Juma Madeira, a <i>Vertragsarbeiter</i> (“contract worker”) from Mozambique, is shown in the image above posing on the roof of his friend’s car outside of a worker’s hostel near the motorbike factory where he worked in Zschopau, East Germany. Juma was one of approximately 20,000 Mozambican workers who traveled to the German Democratic Republic (GDR) as part of a <a href="treaty">reciprocal agreement</a> finalized in February 1979. [1] According to a profile of Juma in the 2023 book <i>Remembering African Labor Migration to the Second World: Socialist Mobilities between Angola, Mozambique, and East Germany</i> by Marcia C. Schenck, Juma spent most of his youth in the GDR: he arrived in East Germany in 1981 when he was eighteen, and returned to Mozambique in 1990 at 27. During his nine years in East Germany Juma completed two four-year contracts at the VEB Motorradwerk Zschopau. He also received intensive language and vocational training on arrival in the GDR, receiving formal certification in 1986. During his second four-year term at the factory Juma was a secretary for the ruling socialist political party in Mozambique, the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (Frente de Libertação de Moçambique or “FRELIMO”).[3] </p>

<p>In the 33 years since German Reunification, the stories of Mozambican <i>Vertragsarbeiter</i> have only sporadically been told. Some <i>Vertragsarbeiter</i> like Juma have happy memories of East Germany, in spite of the difficulties he faced upon returning to Mozambique: when Reunification effectively terminated the East German-Mozambican treaty in 1990, many Mozambicans were forced to return to a country experiencing civil war and a devastated economy with few job prospects, let alone opportunities for employment in the sectors they had been trained in in the GDR. Others, like a woman who became <a href="deport.html">pregnant while working in a garment factory in the rural Ore Mountains of Saxony</a>, were deported for alleged misbehavior. In spite of the ways in which the program was promoted as a friendly and benevolent endevour, its promises were not always realized. </p>

<p>While scholars like Schenck have begun to document the experiences of Vertragsarbeiter during and after their time in Germany, and others have connected the GDR’s foreign labor policies to broader political and economic conditions in the late Cold War, little attention has been given to the spaces in which Mozambicans lived and worked while in East Germany. Through the 1980s, Mozambican <i>Vertragsarbeiter</i> contributed to a wide range of industries in the GDR, and—in spite of practices, intentional or otherwise, which distanced Mozambican workers from East German society—made space for themselves within a changing socialist society. </p>

<p>“SPACES OF LABOR, SPACES OF LIFE” documents these spaces and materials relating to these experiences. Through collected imagery, documents, and an archive of places, this project looks to tell the story of Mozambican <i>Vertragsarbeiter</i> with careful attention to the spaces in the GDR that they experienced and inhabited. East Germany is often referred to as a “closed society,” a country effectively cut off from much of the world beyond the Eastern Bloc. Describing the ways in which non-Germans made space in the GDR is one way to dismantle the myth of “closure” or “isolation.” By asserting that Mozambican <i>Vertragsarbeiter</i> were, as the mapped data shows, present in large parts of the country, this project looks to initiate an examination of the less-known lives on which the GDR relied in its final decade. </p>

<p>In my broader research into the late GDR, I am interested in the concepts of ambivalence and indifference. Certainly the vivid imagery which is foregrounded on the home page of this site does not tell ambivalent or indifferent stories, but these concepts have important implications for scholars of Central and Eastern Europe: from Tara Zahra’s study of interwar “national indifference” as a corrective to conventional studies of nationalism in the region [3] to more recent scholarship on the decline and dissolution of the GDR [4], the conventional binaries which structure the historiography of European Socialism are in recent memory complicated by the claim that other, less assertive but still meaningful trends were important factors. </p>

<p>This project does not make a claim for “indifference” or “ambivalence” as structuring the experiences of Vertragsarbeiter in the GDR. On the contrary, as these images show, Mozambicans who traveled into the GDR to study and work experienced intensely the multifaceted nature of East German society: some experienced violent racism, some were held up as proud examples of socialist solidarity. The “othering” that Vertragsarbeiter experienced had polarizing effects: it underscored racial difference, and it allowed the GDR to position itself as a benevolent force for aid in a moment when postcolonial states needed it most. That is the story these images tell: not an “ambivalent,” but a “bivalent” narrative. In discussing East Germany’s emphasis on solidarity, it is impossible, as Ulrich van der Heyden has suggested, to divorce an earnest attempt to create a better—and socialist—future from an attempt to legitimize the state. [5] This is how, I believe, we must examine this material: freighted with contradictions, the most pressing of which is the simultaneous desire to other and to unify. </p>
