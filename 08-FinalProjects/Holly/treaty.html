   <p>  Below is a translation of the text of the treaty signed in Maputo on February 24, 1979. Honecker’s visit to Maputo was notable enough to <a color=skyblue href="https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/23/archives/east-german-visits-mozambique.html">appear in the Western press</a>. The text of the treaty, which outlines the basic principles of cooperation between the GDR and Mozambique, laid the foundation for the development of the <i>Vertragsarbeiter</i> agreement shortly after. </p>
<hr>
<p><b>Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of Mozambique </b></p>
<p>The German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of Mozambique, beginning with the fraternal friendship and cooperation between their parties and peoples already forged during the Armed Struggle for National Liberation of the Mozambican People and based on Marxism-Leninism and Proletarian Internationalism;
<br>Guided by the desire to contribute to the strengthening of the natural anti-imperialist alliance between Socialist States and the National Liberation Movements and to the further unification of all with the deepening of fraternal friendship and cooperation between the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of Mozambique and to contribute to forces fighting for peace, democracy, and social progress;
<br>Imbued with the ideals of struggle against imperialism, colonialism, neocolonialism, racism, and apartheid;
<br>Determined to contribute to strengthening the peace and security of all peoples;
<br>Willing to further develop the social and economic achievements of both countries and to support each other in doing so;
<br>
Reaffirm their loyalty to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations;
