 <div class="caption">
<p>Before beginning work in the GDR, <i>Vertragsarbeiter</i> signed a contract (<i>Vertrag</i>) with the establishment at which they were to be employed. Mozambicans usually had little agency in where or what their labor in East Germany would be. Above is a sample (<i>Muster</i>) contract, which workers would typically sign before departing Mozambique for the GDR. </p>

<p>The concept of <i>Vertragsarbeit</i> (“contract labor”) was an important distinction between the foreign labor policies of the GDR and the FRG. In West Germany, foreign labor was common after the beginnings of the <i>Wirtschaftswunder</i> in the 1950s, when unprecedented economic growth in the immediate postwar period necessitated a larger workforce. With the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, and the effective loss of any inexpensive labor from East Germany, the FRG reached a <i>Gastarbeit</i> agreement with Turkey. Initially guest workers were made to return to their home country after a one- or two-year term, but policy changes through the 60s and 70s meant that workers effectively “could not be forced out.” [1] This opened paths to long-term residency not available to <i>Vertragsarbiter</i> in the GDR. In the early 1980s, when East Germany’s agreement with Mozambique was still in its early stages, an estimated 4.5 million foreign workers were living and laboring in the FRG. [2]</p>

<p>Unlike in the FRG, contracts in the GDR strictly forbade stays longer than the stipulated labor term. <i>Vertragsarbeiter</i> could sign another contract, effectively doubling their time in East Germany, or in some cases they could stay by attending vocational schools. Yet paths to permanent residency were effectively nonexistent, and most Mozambicans returned to their home country and its wartime economy, with little in the way of the specialized jobs they had trained for abroad. </p>

<p><i>East Germany’s policies around migration and its agreement with Mozambique were meant to open the state to individuals from a new socialist state. Yet at the same time that contracts enabled Mozambican laborers to experience the established “socialist space” that was the GDR, it also maintained means of keeping them distanced from East German society—in part by ensuring that their stays were short and measured.</i></p>
