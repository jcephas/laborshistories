<p>Resistance and Surveillance</p>

   <p> In spite of their sometimes precarious positions within GDR factories, <i>Vertragsarbeiter</i> found occasional ways to mount resistance to their East German supervisors. Of course, foreign laborers faced consequences that their German counterparts did not. The document above is a report made to the Cottbus district branch of the East German Ministry for State Security—conventionally known, in both English and German, and the “Stasi.” The report outlines a strike that happened at the VEB Fleischkombinat Cottbus, an industrial slaughterhouse and meat packing facility, in March 1982. According to the text of the report, a group of 23 workers refused to begin work at 6:00 am on March 11 because they felt they had been underpaid. The last paragraph of text notes that, due to the GDR’s agreement with Mozambique, “150 to 200 marks” are withheld from each paycheck and transferred to Mozambican banks. The “instigator” of this strike was deported to Mozambique. </p>

<div class="caption">
    <p>Indeed, <i>Vertragsarbeiter</i> were subject to constant surveillance. Complaints like those that launched the strike in Cottbus were cause for heightened scrutiny: in the report above, filed at the Stasi departmental office in Hoyerswerda near the Senftenberg open pit mine, a worker is singled out for voicing his frustration that East German workers at the mine were compensated better than their Mozambican colleagues. The report notes that workers, including the one specifically being reported on here, find the compensation structure “an unjustified application of state conventions…they regard this handling by GDR authorities discrimination against the color of their skin and that they could lose respect for the GDR if a more just solution to the problem is not found.” This worker managed to remain in the GDR, and eventually earned higher wages after completing a skilled worker course. He remained under Stasi surveillance. </p>

    <p>On rare occasions, however, <i>Vertragsarbeiter</i> could successfully lobby for better conditions. As laborers from Mozambique did not have agency over what industry they would work in upon arrival in the GDR, some found their entire line of work to be unfavorable. This image is in the archive of Cologne’s <i>Dokumentationszentrum und Museum über die Migration in Deutschland</i> (Documentation Center and Museum of Migration in Germany), and was taken by <i>Vertragsarbeiter</i> Mario Alucuamalas. According to the caption attached to the image, the group were assigned work on a fruit farm, and “rebelled (rebelliert) until they were transferred.” We don’t have much information about this group or their tactics of resistance, but their success must have been admirable—and likely came at a price.</p>

<p> Vertragsarbeiter <i>were often faced with difficult or unfavorable working conditions. They occasionally mobilized as a group in order to advocate for themselves, and were sometimes vocal about experiencing racism in the workplace. Spaces of labor could be spaces of resistance, although resisting was not without consequences.</i></p>
