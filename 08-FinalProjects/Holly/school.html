The <i>Schule der Freundschaft</i>: teaching socialism, learning the GDR

   <p>  Perhaps the best-documented aspect of Mozambique-East Germany relations was the <i>Schule der Freundschaft</i> (“School of Friendship”) in Staßfurt, today in the Federal State of Saxony-Anhalt. From 1982 until 1988 the school educated close to 900 Mozambican children. In addition to standard high school subjects, pupils in Staßfurt took classes in Marxist-Leninist political theory, Portuguese, and African geography. [1] </p>

<p>A German school for Mozambican children was first proposed by FRELIMO in 1980. Mozambique had a similar arrangement with its socialist ally Cuba, and by the early 1980s over 4,000 children were studying in the Caribbean nation. The GDR actually modeled the Schule der Freundschaft after its Cuban predecessor, studying its curriculum in order to better understand practices of second-language acquisition. [2] East German Secretary of Education Margot Honecker (wife of SED General Secretary Erich Honecker) oversaw the development of the school. Children aged 12 to 14 were selected from around Mozambique in an effort to send a range of students from different regions, backgrounds, and class positions. </p>

<p> In addition to students, 23 Mozambicans also worked as trainee teachers at the Schule der Freundschaft. FRELIMO had stipulated that it was these teachers, and not the East Germans, who would be responsible for teaching Portuguese, geography, and political theory. This became contentious, as doubts were raised regarding the quality and content of political education. [3] </p>

<p>Locals were discouraged from approaching the school, and its facilities were gated—an intentional barrier between the East German industrial community of Staßfurt and the Mozambican students within the school’s walls. In 1986, after the students began various types of vocational training, they gained more access to the local community—to both positive and negative effects. While the students, now teenagers and young adults, had more freedom to socialize in town, they also experienced racism from the local youth who also frequented Staßfurt’s few clubs. On one occasion, this was deadly: on September 19, 1987, Carlos Conceição was murdered by an East German after an altercation at the local youth club. Carlos, who could not swim, was thrown into the Bode River. His death had an immediate effect on the school: students protested what they saw as the lax police response to the murder, and in the words of one former student, caused the student body to become more vigilant and wary of violent racism in the Staßfurt community. </p>

<p>Samora Machel, the leader of FRELIMO and President of Mozambique, was killed in a plane crash in 1986. After his death the FRELIMO party changed political tact, eventually distancing itself from socialism. As such, a school dedicated to training Mozambican students in the tenets of Marxism-Leninism became unpalatable, and Schule der Freundschaft was closed in 1988. FRELIMO had been at war with the anti-communist group RENAMO since 1977, and after Machel’s death the violence increased. This was the reality that former students at the Schule der Freundschaft returned to in their home country: in spite of specialized vocational training, most struggled to find jobs in a wartime economy. </p>
