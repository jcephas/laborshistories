		<p id="p01"> The paradoxical flattening of Marxist historical teleology into an unhistorical practice of labour in the novella necessarily problematises the ontological stakes of collectivisation and with it those of the Stalinist language-cum-labour-reality. The narrative switches freely between the third-person narration and focalisations of different characters, loosing itself from the authority of any one character’s perspective. Through this narrative structure, the novella mimics both the official imperative to collectivise and the unofficial ontological unchaining of the historical future from the unhistorical present necessitated by the Socialist project. This structural unchaining is semantically replicated by the semantic motif of orphanhood which straddles all focalisations of the narrative. The Socialist utopia and collectivisation alike are portrayed as a «чистое» (‘clean’, 216) and «вечно[е] сиротств[о]» (‘eternal orphanhood’, 240), in that both are seen to require the absolute disavowal of the past and of those who have laboured to achieve them. In particular, the Socialist utopia is depicted as a realm restricted to children from which its very progenitors are excluded: «Сафронов, Вощев и все другие землекопы долго наблюдали сон этого малого существа[Nastia], которое будет господствовать над их могилами и жить на успокоенной земле, набитой их костьми» (‘For a long time, Safronov, Voshchev and the other diggers observed the sleep of this little creature[Nastia], who would rule above their graves and live on a calmed earth, stuffed with their bones’, 218). This premises an ontological rift between the creators and inheritors of the Earth. Therefore, the material world worked by the labourers becomes invested with significant eschatological anxiety, reflecting the workers’ unhistorical disenfranchisement from the historical teleology of which their labour is a part.</p>

		<p id="p02">The unmaking of man through collectivised labour and the ontological orphanhood of the workers are developed further through what Iosif Brodskii has termed Platonov’s ‘semantic dead-end’.<a href="#footnote23"> <sup>23</sup></a>  The use of language in <em>Kotlovan</em> breaks both the conventional referential link (signifier-signified) posited by Saussurean linguistics and the ontological causality (signified-signifier) of Stalinist discourse. For example, in a moment of doubt the worker Safronov exclaims, «Неужели внутри всего света тоска, а только в нас одних пятилетний план?» (‘Can it be that inside the whole world there is sadness, and that inside us alone there is the five-year plan?’, 197). Here, the antonymic contrast structured syntactically between toska (‘yearning’, ‘longing’, ‘melancholy’) and the five-year plan parodies the notion that collectivisation has transformed the men through labour to the extent that contentment might be replaced by labour, but it also begs the question as to which ontological scenario could reasonably account for such an antonymy. Such skewed semantic (dis)connections characterise Platonov’s style throughout the novella, presenting a devastating travesty of Stalinist language-reality and tragic contemplation of the labour-reality it produces. Another notable example is that of the woman in the village, who recounts her husband’s suffering to the pit diggers:</p>

      			style="width:620px;height:120px;object-fit:cover"> 
    		</div>	
    		<div class="hover">
      			<img src="quotationC02.jpg" alt=""
      			style="width:635px;height:120px; object-fit:cover;">
    		</div>
  		</div>	
		<p id="p03">	The woman explains how, dying of starvation, her husband begs for something to put inside him (food), saying that he feels that his soul has already left his body, but, knowing that they do not have any food, he interprets his hunger as commensurate with the imagined physical weight of the metaphysical soul he has lost and so shouts for the wife to tie a weight to his chest. Absolute material crisis becomes subject to semantic ambiguity and proliferation, such that, in engaging with the abstract question of how much a soul might weigh, we come to semantically circumvent life and death as an empirical binary. Through the introduction of multiple non-intersecting ontologies, the language of the novella ultimately seems to deontologise everything, displacing Stalinist ontological certainty and introducing doubt as the basic semantic paradigm. Ultimately <em>Kotlovan</em>’s ‘semantic dead end’ cruelly ironises our inability to correlate language with labour at the moment of collectivisation: if there is an indubitable, lived reality we can no longer access it – or even approach it – through language. </p>
