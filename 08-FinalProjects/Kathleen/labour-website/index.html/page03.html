		<p id="p01">  Although he would ultimately be reviled for anti-Soviet slander in 1946,<a href="#footnote12"> <sup>12</sup></a> in many of his works, Andrei Platonov (1899-1951) demonstrates a ‘more than superficial commitment to the Soviet project’.<a href="#footnote13"> <sup>13</sup></a> This leaves his posthumously published novella <em>Kotlovan</em> (‘The Foundation Pit’, 1930) in an interesting position.<a href="#footnote14"> <sup>14</sup></a> Whereas Marxist labour motivates the teleological creation of man and Stalinist discourse attempts to ontologise language as labour, by the time of <em>Kotlovan</em>’s writing, these precepts had been brought to a painful impasse through collectivisation, and the novella treats both with suspicion. In <em>Kotlovan</em>, Platonov not only unmoors man from his teleological creation through labour, but thus also disconnects him from the future Socialist utopia, an alienation which has significant ramifications for his ontological understanding of labourers and labour in the world, and ultimately extends to the total destabilisation of language.<a href="#footnote15"> <sup>15</sup></a>

		<h3 id="head03">Plot Summary of <em>Kotlovan</em></h3>
		<p id="p02">In <em>Kotlovan</em>, the dismissed factory-worker Voshchev joins a group of diggers working on a foundation pit upon which, they are told, an enormous house will be built for the future proletariat. The plot of the novella follows Voshchev’s quest to find the meaning of life as one narrative strand among many others, which variously deal with the death of a bourgeois woman (Iuliia) and the adoption of her daughter (Nastia) by Chiklin and the other foundation-pit diggers; the amputee Zhachev’s vendetta against the local trade-union chairman (Pashkin); the murder of the most and least politically earnest workers (Safronov and Kozlov respectively); a kulak-purge by the workers and a bear-worker followed by the collectivisation of the farm; and, finally, Nastia’s death, Zhachev’s disappearance and the grave that Chiklin digs for the child. The novella closes with Nastia’s interment and the workers’ realisation that they are destined to keep digging for as long as they live. While some critics have attempted to interpret <em>Kotlovan</em> as a work of pure existential dread,<a href="#footnote16"> <sup>16</sup></a> the sense of futility that pervades the novella must be understood in terms of concerns about language and labour contemporaneous to collectivisation.<a href="#footnote17"> <sup>17</sup></a>

		<p id="p06">[15] ‘Against this [Stalinism’s] specious urge toward ontological and linguistic fusion, whose motivations he in part shares but whose acute error he feels compelled to expose, Platonov asserts with unswerving pessimism the fundamental and insuperable disharmony of the cosmos, the greatest evidence for which lies in the essence of language itself’. Thomas Seifrid, ‘Writing against Matter: On the Language of Andrej Platonov’s <em>Kotlovan</em>’, <em>The Slavic and East European Journal</em> 31, no.3 (Autumn 1987): 384. While I share Seifrid’s conviction that Platonov directs a pointed critique against the Stalinist paradigm of language, I do not believe the primary basis for Platonov’s opposition to be grounded in the cosmic opposition of metaphysics and the physical world but rather the dissonance between the multiple theories and praxes of Marxism-Leninism-Stalinism which were drawn into conflict during the early Stalin-period (a conflict made especially visible by collectivisation). </p>
