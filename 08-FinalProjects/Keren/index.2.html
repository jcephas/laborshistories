  To be an enslaved woman of African descent at this time was deadly and wholly so, because this conglomerate of tissue and organ that is built to sustain life has been quite literally translated into the economic system as a machine. Rice processing involves three operations: threshing, milling, and winnowing. These processes take care of the removal of the talk, hulls, and pounding of the grains in order to harvest the rice. This process, was extremely grueling and strenuous, often taking hours at a time of consistent applied strength.
<br/>
<br/>
“Slavery shifted the temporal pattern of rice milling in Africa, characterized by women pounding the cereal for a short period of time each day of the year, to one that compressed milling into just a few months. The shift demanded that slaves spend grueling hours processing rice. Then, as the rice export economy placed ever greater demands on labor, rice processing required dissolving its African basis as a female responsibility to that both men and women processed the crop.” (Carney, 138).

  	R.F.W.Allston, father of Elizabeth Allston, and generational heir to the Chicora Wood rice plantation, “..described hand milling the rough rice as a process in which the grains were passed between wooden blocks, twenty inches in diameter and six inches thick, and worked by hand.” (Carney, p.130) These women would work deep into the night to produce triple their weight in grains of rice. Allston also commented, “The method was, that each male laborer had three pecks of rough rice in a mortar, and each female two pecks, to pound before day or sun-rise; and the same at night, after finishing the ordinary task in the field.” (Carney, p.133)
<br/>
<br/>

Chicora Wood, owned by the Allston family, was one of the largest producers of rice in the South. In the 1800’s there were recorded to be 600+ enslaved people on the plantation grounds. Being that this was a rice plantation, the majority of the enslaved population were women due to this identifiably gendered practice of rice harvesting.

  	As rice production grew in the colonies South Carolinas enslaved African population grew to 90,000 people in 1765. These people were recorded to have harvested approximately 40,000 tons of rice that was exported to Europe. 
<br/>
<br/>
	These were women’s hands, executing women’s skills through cultural practice. What does it mean to have your culture reappropriated for another cause, and to have yourself be the main agent of the stretching of what was once sacred?

<br/>
	“Because women figure so centrally in rice culture in West Africa, the question arises whether the patterns of labor with slave-produced rice bear any resemblance to the gender division of labor found historically in West African rice cultivation…Given the historical significance of women in African rice systems, the concern here is to illuminate whether patterns of rice development in colonial South Carolina and Georgia reveal the residue of a knowledge system transmitted by African women across the Middle Passage.” (Carney, 120)
