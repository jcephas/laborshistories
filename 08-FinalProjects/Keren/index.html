By way of this interactive, screen-based, environment is an archive of the intermingled identities of worker, laborer, property, and individual due to the subjectivity of the enslaved Black African Woman. This work aims to uncover how we might we define the agency of the Black body through its objectification as both laborer and worker, and further understand the entanglement of cultural identity and practice that in a post-colonial world has become means of extraction for monetary gain.  

Through this thought framework, harnessed within the limits of these pre-emancipation texts and recollections, there will be an uncovering and discovering some of the various methods of which the Black Woman’s body has become the central sustainer of American infrastructure, and how the study and speculation of African cultural practice has been commoditized for the sake of labor/work production. Through this process, it is the Black Woman who is pushed into a state of subjectivity.

The main case study under investigation in this project is the life of a field hand on a South Carolina rice plantation. More specifically, Elizabeth W. Allston Pringle and Alice R. Huger Smith’s recollection of life on the plantation in the diary, A Woman Rice Planter. A Woman Rice Planter, as a text introduces us to the issues, I am to address just in being. This text, entitled A Woman Rice Planter, follows the life of Elizabeth, rather than those that plant the rice. Despite the narrative power of presenting a powerfully wealthy southern plantation owner, all of the imagery and illustration focuses on the day-to-day tasks and lives of the Black Women who are enslaved on the grounds. 

The rich primary sources of the direct records from the Allston family, and accounts of their estates, along with the dense history of African rice farming and the exploitation of such skills in American slavery, I would hope to provide some insight onto how the women on this plantation might have viewed their work and labor first-hand.

Agriculture has traditionally been a gendered practice on a global scale. The division of labor from hunter gatherer even to that of the plantation produces a very specific environment where value can be extracted from the work that one practices. The conception of this labor practice soon begins to infiltrate the object of identity, producing a person now in a subject position
Women from the ivory and gold coasts of Africa were particularly sought out by slave traders due to their expertise in sewing, growing, and cultivating, rice crops. It has been recorded that female slaves received higher purchase prices in South Carolina than in other plantation economies due to the value of their labor. Knowledge of the rice patty was quite specific to West African culture at the time, and specifically to women.
