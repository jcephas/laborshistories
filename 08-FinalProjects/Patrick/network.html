<h3><b><span>the Philippine Carceral Network<span></b></h3>
<p class=indent>In the context of the Philippines between 1899, the founding of the American military government; and 1935, the founding of the Philippine Commonwealth government, incarceration formed a foundational social institution for the stability of an oppressive and extractive political economy made more efficient under American security. As Alfred W. McCoy articulates, “the Philippines has been the site of a protracted social experiment in the use of police as an instrument of state power. Indeed, America’s ad hoc experiment with colonial policing was mutually transformative, central in both the transformation of the Philippine polity and the formation of the U.S. national security state.”<sup><a href="#footnote-1-text" rel="footnote" id="footnote-1-link">1</a></sup> Indeed, as chronicled by Colonel John Roberts White in his 1928 memoir entitled Bullets and Bolos, the Philippine Constabulary’s primary task in the provinces across the archipelago was to pacify communities of anticolonial resistance by any means necessary, whether by murder or incarceration. One of his main targets, his archnemesis Papa Isio, was defined as a criminal under Spanish rule and had, by 1903, established an autonomous, maroon community in the mountains of Negros Occidental.<sup><a href="#footnote-2-text" rel="footnote" id="footnote-2-link">2</a></sup>

<div class=caption>Papa Isio (center) with two followers in jail in Bacolod, 1907. Harry H. Bandholtz Papers.</div>

<p class=indent>While Papa Isio escaped White’s grasp, he was eventually captured and incarcerated in Bilibid Prison in Manila, where a growing population of Filipinos engaged in anticolonial marronage mixed with groups of criminalized laborers and unemployed natives in what would become the largest prison in the Pacific. Similar stories would play across the archipelago for many years to come; incarceration as a colonial and social project would prove crucial to the governance of the incredibly diverse group of communities and landscapes that form the Philippine islands.</p>

  <h3><b><span>the Forest of Products</b></span></h3>
    <p class=indent>Only a few years prior, the American military government was taking stock of and ordering its newly acquired resources from the Philippine landscape under management bureaus such as the Bureau of Forestry, established in 1900 by the Military Governor under General Order No. 50. Operating as a semi-military organization, the bureau's first director was Captain George P. Ahearn of the 96th U.S. Infantry. By 1909, the Bureau of Forestry had established several state-led operations in forest product harvest, ranging from primary timber products (hardwoods for building and furniture production, including narra [Philippine mahogany], acle, and others); secondary timber products (including dyewood and charcoal); as well as rattan for furniture production. These two categories are depicted by geographical region in the maps below, and overlaid onto a diagram of the Philippine carceral network (PCN).</p>

    <img src=img/6FORESTrattan.png style="width:45%">

  <img src=img/7FORESTtimber.png style="width:45%">


  <p class=indent>Harvesting timber involves cutting old-growth forest and processing the wood in sawmills scattered throughout the Philippine islands. Notably, the Philippine carceral network had its own sawmills at Iwahig Penal Colony on Palawan and in San Ramon Prison and Penal Farm in Mindanao. The Bureau of Forestry had additionally, by 1902, established a “mechanical laboratory” in an old building in Manila to test timber for strength, durability, and applications for construction and furniture design. The laboratory was situated on the Pasig River, the main waterway in Manila, allowing for water-borne timber shipments from the provinces to be processed quickly and efficiently. In the bureau’s 1902 annual report, the quality of woods found in the Philippine “virgin” forests were such that processed woods such as narra, tindalo, camagon, ebano, calamansanay, and others would attract “fine-furniture makers.”<sup><a href="#footnote-3-text" rel="footnote" id="footnote-3-link">3</a></sup> In the following sections of the report, the potential monetary value of “virgin forest” in the Philippines is emphasized and is of primary concern. This value would, at least in part, be extracted through the prison workshops of Bilibid.</p>


<p class=indent>As Stephen Siebert notes in his 2012 book-length study, <i>The Nature and Culture of Rattan: Reflections on Vanishing Life in the Forests of Southeast Asia</i>, the flexible, durable vines of the rattan palm (from the Javanese rotan; taxonomic name calamus rotang) have formed the foundation for a multibillion dollar cane-furniture industry growing since at least the 19th century. Narra wood, meanwhile, (also known as “Philippine mahogany”) is one of the hardest woods in the world and thus ideal for interior design; architects from Frank Lloyd Wright to Joseph Eichler have used narra for cabinetry, doors, and furniture.</p>

<p class=indent>First, however, these ventures in forest product creation (as a mode of landscape valorization) would require not only comprehensive methods of social, political, and economic control, but also trade and transport infrastructures. As John R. White mentions in his memoir, the “kinds of roads Americans built” were essential to bringing civilization to racialized native communities as an infrastructural project, especially as sponsored by the American imperialist state and made popular through visual culture.</p>

<h3><b><span>Insular Prison Network</span></b></h3>

<h2>San Ramon Penal Farm</h2>
    <p class=indent>As part of the establishment of a colonial government, the U.S. released Act No. 222 of the Philippine Commission, creating a number of government bureaus including the Bureau of Prisons, which managed the Bilibid Prison and San Ramon Prison Colony. Originally established in 1870 by Spanish royal decree, the carceral project in Mindanao came with the ongoing governmental urge to quell the near-constant anticolonial insurrection by Moro Islamic communities in the southern Philippines. The American colonial government project inherited this problem, and American military rule was extended from 1899 to as late as 1916. For the Americans, however, the San Ramon Prison and Penal Farm was a key component of this political suppression, while also proving to be a key “civilizing” force helpful in extracting value from the Mindanaoan landscape using native Mindanaoan labor. </p>

    <h2>Bontoc Prison</h2>

<p class=indent>The Bontoc Prison, established in the ancestral Ifugao lands in the Mountain Province, was not only a mark of civilization, but also an ideal educational institution for civilizing the “half primitive people” residing outside of colonial governance.<sup><a href="#footnote-4-text" rel="footnote" id="footnote-4-link">4</a></sup> Victorio proudly asserts that in Bontoc Prison, the “traditional habits and customs resulting in murder…have been forgotten…These Igorot are taught industrial occupations and when they regain their freedom they return to their respective tribes with some useful knowledge.”<sup><a href="#footnote-5-text" rel="footnote" id="footnote-5-link">5</a></sup> By establishing a mountain prison with Bilibid as a model, the Bureau of Prisons was able to remove indigenous people from their lands, enforce the acquisition of industrial skills and craftmanship, and send them back to their communities to incorporate national economics into the evolution of indigenous lifestyle.


<p style="text-align:center"><img src=img/5BONTOCbirthplace.png
    text-align=center 
    width= '70%'
    height='auto'></p>

<p class=indent>The administration of the province—defined by the Cordillera mountain range in which indigenous, peasant, and revolutionary nationalist forces have long been established—was a major project with roots in the American Commonwealth government, which enlisted urban planner David Burnham to design the city of Baguio in 1904 as the “summer capital of the Philippines.” The planned city of Baguio replaced the patchwork Spanish ranchería settlement system with a fully developed urban administrative plan. On August 18th, 1908, the American Commonwealth Government expanded administration of the region with Act No. 1876 announcing the establishment of the Mountain Province. The Act simultaneously established Bontoc Prison “for the detention and confinement of provincial prisoners of the Mountain Province and of Insular prisoners who are members of non-Christian tribes of the Mountain Province or of the Province of Nueva Vizcaya,” geographically visualized in the concentration of incarcerated indigenous people from Luzon.<sup><a href="#footnote-6-text" rel="footnote" id="footnote-6-link">6</a></sup></p>

<h2>Iwahig Penal Colony</h2>
<p class=indent>The American civil government established the Iwahig Prison Colony on Palawan 17 kilometers west of the Puerto Princesa in 1904, allotting 22 acres for the creation of a prison colony as a proposed solution to the rapidly overcrowding, centralized Bilibid Prison in Manila. Then Governor General Luke Wright sent R.J. Shields, an employee and foreman at Bilibid, along with 61 incarcerated Filipinos, with the task of clearing, building on, and cultivating the land.<sup><a href="#footnote-7-text" rel="footnote" id="footnote-7-link">7</a></sup> By the middle of 1905, the population of those incarcerated in the colony rose to 313, and acted as a punishment of semi-exile for the supposed worst of the worst in Bilibid. However, by 1906, the population steadily increasing, charismatic incarcerated leaders rose to prominence and established extractive hierarchies among the colonists. High mortality rates plagued the colony, and several insurrections and escape attempts occurred throughout the beginning years of the prison.</p>

  <div class=caption>Image from Catalogue of Products of the Industrial Division of Bilibid Prison, and General Information Relative to the Bureau of Prisons, 1924.</div>

<p class=indent>John R. White was appointed as superintendent of the Iwahig Penal Colony by W. Cameron Forbes, then Secretary of Commerce and Police and soon to be Governor General from 1909 to 1913. As a man steeped in white male respectability politics, White admiringly notes Forbes’s pedigree in his memoir: “as might be expected of a man whose maternal grandfather was Ralph Waldo Emerson and paternal grandfather John Murray Forbes, this Forbes was a practical idealist—a builder of things and of men.”<sup><a href="#footnote-8-text" rel="footnote" id="footnote-8-link">8</a></sup> Two men of like mind and spirit, Forbes and White collaborated closely in the name of the civilizational project. As a leading technician in the vast laboratory of social control, White had proved his mettle in remolding Filipinos into idealized agents of the colonial state. White recounts a conversation with Forbes, musing that “if the Filipinos were capable of self-government in their municipalities they might be trusted under certain restrictions to govern themselves in a penal colony without the irritating restraint of armed warders.”<sup><a href="#footnote-9-text" rel="footnote" id="footnote-9-link">9</a></sup></p>

<div class=parallax3>

<br><div class=spacer2>Saw mill and ice plant, Iwahig Penal Colony, c. 1916. Library of Congress.</div></div>

<p class=indent>By the time Forbes enlisted White to develop the colony into a more efficiently self-governing, subsistent, and economically productive project, it had fallen into disrepute and relative anarchy. Still, according to John White, Forbes “saw not only the economic waste of a prison system which confined men within four walls. But he also sensed the tragedies in the lives of broken men—men who might be reconstructed and of use instead of danger to society. Mr. Forbes believed that men who had broken society’s laws had not necessarily dropped from the level of intelligent human beings to that of debased brutes.”<sup><a href="#footnote-10-text" rel="footnote" id="footnote-10-link">10</a></sup></p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src=img/3IPCbirthplace.png

<p class=indent>By 1907, White had succeeded in leading a colony of incarcerated Filipinos in settling the allotted land, resulting in a physically, socially, and morally sanitized laboratory for civilizational development. White had crafted a kind of plantation republic whose educational value primarily related first to sanitation, then to lasting industry, order, and economic subordination under a single leader. Indeed, included in the Act was the authorization of the superintendent of the Iwahig penal colony “to sell the products of the colony, manufactured or otherwise, and to allow the prisoners of the higher grades or classes such percentage of the value of said products as may be approved by the Secretary of Public Instruction.” Physical and moral sanitation were thus pretexts for socioeconomic control in the colony. This idealization of labor and productivity simultaneously operated within the Philippine carceral network by way of the sawmill that, along with the San Ramon Penal Farm sawmill, worked to process lumber to be usable by craftsment in the Bilibid Workshop.</p>

<div id=bilibid class=parallax4><br>
    <h3><b><span>Bilibid Prison</span></b></h3></div>

    <p class=indent> In Bilibid Prison, the majority of incarcerated laborers came from the lowland regions of Luzon and from the central Visayas region of the Philippines; in other words, Christianized Filipinos. The few incarcerated women crafted specialty lace products, while men were put to work in divisions for metalwork and automobile repair, building construction and repair, and both hardwood and rattan/bamboo furniture for sale. While BuCor did offer pay for the incarcerated laborers’ work, a majority of the profits remained in BuCor hands thanks to the administration’s sales division, which handled marketing and shipping internationally. Bilibid Prison, as the main insular prison in the administrative center of Manila, would become the most critical node in a vast prison network that mobilized definitions of criminality to maintain social order amidst near constant insurgency in the long Philippine Revolution, while also providing a bureaucratic mode of state capitalism whose methods of forced labor were simultaneously methods to engage in racialized discourses of  “civilization.”</p>


<p style="text-align:center"><img src=img/2Bilibidbirthplace.png
    text-align=center 
    width= '70%'
    height='auto'></p>

    <p class=indent>Inside of the prison, labor in the Industrial Division was supposedly to “provide instructive employment for deserving prisoners and to furnish an avenue which earnest men may equip themselves with a trade with which to reenter society on an independent, self-respecting basis.”<sup><a href="#footnote-11-text" rel="footnote" id="footnote-11-link">11</a></sup> According to the Bureau of Corrections, a spirit of craftsmanship was truly adopted by the program, limiting workdays to seven and a half hours while also providing instruction by way of “mechanical drawing, plan reading, and designing,” taught by “more advanced” incarcerated students. However, this simultaneously functioned to replicate socially reproductive forms of labor and commodity production; as the workshop was in a prison, there was a vast reserve of potential laborers whose physical and mental willingness to perform the labor of designing, drawing, and reading could be surveilled and used to define incarcerated laborers as “shirkers” of responsibility.<sup><a href="#footnote-12-text" rel="footnote" id="footnote-12-link">12</a></sup> This model of social reproduction inside of the prison so as to more effectively produce ideal craft laborers outside of the prison was effective to the extent that Bilibid’s “output” averaged, in 1926, about 350,000 pesos worth of furniture per year, “utilizing” the “services” of roughly 1,400 incarcerated men in the Industrial Division.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src=1924furniture/bilibidplan.png
    text-align=center 
    width= '70%'

    <p class=indent>The Industrial Division itself was divided into different departments according to service given or commodity produced. Department A was dedicated to the upkeep of machines and vehicles, as well as blacksmithing, upholstering, sheet-metal work, and carriage making. Interestingly, while the carriages are presented in the 1912 version of the catalogue, in 1924 it is stated that “it is manifestly impossible to illustrate the product of this division in a catalogue.”<sup><a href="#footnote-13-text" rel="footnote" id="footnote-13-link">13</a></sup></p>

    <p class=indent>Departments B and D were dedicated to the creation of hardwood and wicker furniture, respectively. Each department was led by a skilled foreman, but the craftsmanship of each worker—especially in Department B, the hardwood division—was emphasized as referenced by the ongoing passing of knowledge in designing, drawing, and planning production. Additionally, the catalogue notes that “40 varieties of native wood” are the most suitable for furniture, though “the most popular” are narra, acle, tindalo, camagon, tanguile, lauan, and lumbayao. The wickerware Department D seems to have been less detailed in its design work, and was led by a single “competent wickerware designer.” Still, there was an enormous variety of products, including hammocks, reclining chairs, reading chairs, table, shelves, and more. Department D’s signature product, most well known both then and now, is the “Bilibid Chair” or “Peacock Chair.”</p>

    <p class=indent>Other departments in Bilibid prison included Department C, dedicated to the construction of prison buildings and the manufacture and repair of prison equipment. Department F was a tailor shop, employing 60 incarcerated laborers helping to clothe any Philippine governmental laborers including prisoners, sailors, police officers, etc. Department G laundered these clothing, but also invited civilian engagement. FInally, Department H was the women’s labor division, which was dedicated solely to embroidery, lace making, and crochet. While these materials were also made from native materials using extracted native labor, as there is less comprehensive documentation for this kind of work and as women formed a smaller percentage of the overall incarcerated labor force, this along with other departments remain outside the purview of this project.</p>
