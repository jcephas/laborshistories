			In this week’s readings the authors analyze how working class bodies are constituted by and constitutive of the workplace (Baron, Boris, 23). By considering  embodiment, the authors reveal how different subjects have been negotiated and contorted in spaces of production as the subject’s body becomes quantified as a resource (34). In the case of industrial Pittsburgh during the early 1900s, worker’s bodies were not only physically transformed by labor, but also highly idealized in order to champion ideals of the “productive” and “strong” body and environment. The outward public facing representation and proliferation of the productive body, was complemented by classification and stratification of worker types. These divisions delineated skills and bodily specifications that synchronized workers with machines. The fully immersed body that becomes rhythmically aligned with its work, is viewed as a standardized component of the capitalist machine. This symbiosis was highlighted by Slavishak, who argued that, “the key for employers was not to make workers and machines compete but to coordinate their efforts into a single pursuit of industry” (104). The singular pursuit of industry that intends to strip workers away from different embodiments and spheres of rest, presents a contested ground, as energy, emotion, and physiology can never be separated from the subject. Even though the coupling of man and machine during the early twentieth century reflects the “classification of body techniques according to efficiency” described in Mauss’ piece, by considering the embodiment of historically marginalized workers, how might we understand how workers have transcended training systems and rankings of effectiveness enacted by the workplace (464)? This can potentially be interrogated through a lens that analyzes instances that position the body as a site of resistance and recognition of its liberating potential (Baron, Boris, 43). However, as seen in Kuskey’s piece, which presents narratives that illustrate the atrocities and abstractions that factory workers were subjected to, I am left wondering what position the abstracted and abused body takes in transcending the workplace, if it is ever allowed to do so? Kuskey argues that the “disconnections between individuals’ stories of their own painful lives and their politically necessary acceptance of an abstracted body invites new approaches to critical analysis of the body” (8). Can abstracted bodies ever actually be liberated from the production systems that define them? Or are these bodies permanently stuck and redefined by optimized production economies as their sustenance seems to be intrinsically tied to their work?
