			This week’s readings presented how the understandings of black and white working bodies have developed different meanings as historical analysis has led to the acknowledgment of shifting fluid racial ideologies across time and space (Jones, 613). The North American focus of the readings highlighted how the settler colonial beginnings of the United States established a “popular sense of whiteness” that would distinguish Europeans from Africans and indigenous people (Roediger, 21). As European colonists arrived to the Americas, they brought the social ideologies and orders that were ingrained in their Western-European societies. The remnants of the feudal system that manifested through capitalism, accentuated the classification of the other and racist attitudes that constantly redefined relations of the subject to labor given the historical context of the times. Did different generational understandings and estrangement from the direct European continental context affect the transmittance of these notions for the descendants of colonists? How did the physical distancing from Europe transform, reappropriate, or erase certain systems of power in the North American context? 

			The social order that came to define the New World was entrenched in European social stratification that differentiated regional, subcultural, and dialectical differences into racial differences (Robinson, 26). These differences that were used to define white superiority also predicated different economies, labor, and politics. Trotter highlights how “working-class whites endorsed colonization as a way to remove competitors from the labor force” in North America (23). This recolonization threatened African American competitors who would be further prohibited from becoming free wage earning working class citizens, as poor and working class whites would take these positions and secure a place in the economy and politics of the nation (23). The colonizationists reflect how notions of European expansion and social structure were actively present in the social psyche. The translation of this colonial notion directly onto labor economies and practices, reflects what Robinson argues to be as “racialism and its permutations persisted, rooted not in a particular era but in the civilization itself” (28). Even though the various authors this week reflect on how fluid notions of race proffer more holistic understandings of social divisions, Robinson’s statement highlights how the rootedness of racialism has a sense of a particular origin from where it evolved. Has this rootedness in civilization (significantly contorted by historical European social structures and economies) affected the creation of spatial imaginaries that displace local geographies, realities, and societies, as distancing and neo-colonial practices re-shape territories?
