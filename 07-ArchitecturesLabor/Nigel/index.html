			<h1>Architecture's Labor, Reading Response</h1>
			<p> In this week’s readings from Peggy Deamer, Mardges Bacon, and Adrienne Brown labor is cast simultaneously as a site of oppression of the worker and a site of activity and agency of the worker across topics as varying as artistic production, politics, and race. Across all three of the readings, an understanding of the active power of work as a material practice is expanded and the opportunities found in such an understanding are unpacked. </p>

					In Deamer’s chapter titled “Work,” the author discusses two dialectics involving labor: of art and labor, and of of work and play. In discussing the relationship between art and labor in analyzing the architectural profession’s classification of their work as creative instead of labor, Deamer cites a tradition of theoretical, political, and historical analysis on the interrelation of art and labor. She describes theories which argue that work should be a model for art, citing walter Benjamin’s “Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,” in contrast to those which argue that art shapes the logics of work, citing Ranciere’s The Politics of Aesthetics: The Distribution of the Sensible. While Ranciere’s perspective is more reminiscent of the importation of social, political, and cultural phenomena (such as race and gender) into acts and structures of labor, Deamer’s invocation of the Frankfurt School, Relational Aesthetics, and the Russian Constructivist reminds us that labor is constructed of material actions, each of which may accumulate into a site of intervention, opportunity, or influence. That is, work and workers operate within a productive landscape, shaping social practices as conceptually distant for the workplace as art. In concluding her chapter, Deamer invokes the reaches of work as a productive landscape towards yet another sphere—politics—as she argues for alternative organizations of architectural workers from the current, exploitative model.				</div>

					On work’s ability to form a politics, Bacon turns to the Federation of Architects, Enigineers, Chemists and Technicians (FAECT) of the interwar-period. In her essay, Bacon describes the titular trade union as “a model for political engagement and social practice as well as a site of architectural discourse” (454). In the first issue of the federation’s Bulletin, Lewis Mumford writes that the technician must “learn to work, as a member of a collective body, for the positive good of society,” and that participating in FAECT’s “political struggle” was how such work would be achieved. As a result Bacon shows us how FAECT approached the architectural profession as a site for politics due to labor being a site of political struggle itself. Just as Deamer reminds us that work may shape art, Bacon and FAECT remind us that work may shape politics as well.

					Adrienne Brown’s analysis of representations of labor in the building of Skyscrapers differs in that the author’s focus is not on the productive construction of new social spheres found in acts of labor but rather the erasure of race is the representations of work. Her analysis, centering on descriptions of the Starrett brothers on the labor used to construct their buildings as well as coverage of skyscraper labor in other publications around the turn of the century, charts two methods of erasure: the total displacement of race from the labor described by the Starretts, or the removal of reference to non-white workers when race is described at all. In these representations of labor race is totally removed, yet in the specific acts of labor, I wonder how such a veiling of race could operate. That is, in the acts of labor which constructed early skyscraper’s in their materiality inherently were the sites for expressions of race. That while representation might displace race, labor itself was a site which housed race. As we have discussed in art and politics, labor’s active and material reality offer sites for other material practices to occur in conjunction. Here, we can see that work is a potential site of resistance against multiple ideological structures				</div>
