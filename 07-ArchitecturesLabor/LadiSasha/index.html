        <h2> "... race puts forward a material reconstruction of architectural history."</h2>
        <p> This final set of essays on architecture’s labor made generative intertextual connections to our previous discussions on racialized labor, working bodies, and labor histories. They thread how race and labor are critical intersections of architectural history, theory, and practice. Tethering the categories of race, labor, and architecture together can create a ripple effect that shifts ideological and rhetorical frameworks. In which the category of race puts forward a material reconstruction of architectural history; architecture can inform our understanding of racialized labor and processes of racialization at large; and a labor lens can identify or surface the marginalization of racial subject positions alongside the field of architecture’s relationship to matters of the worker, power, consumption, and compensation. </p>

        <h2> "... a racial lens can shift the circuits of power that are centralized across architectural history and criticism."</h2>
        <p>Peggy Dreamer and Mardges Bacon are challenging the idea that labor does not matter to the field, both conceptually, in the way designers think about their work, and materially in regards to histories of collective bargaining and scholarship around the working conditions across the field. While Adrienne Brown’s chapter on the early skyscraper analyzes how the absence of race in architectural history is a process of racialization in and of itself, raising, for me, the extent to which pulling in a racial lens can shift the circuits of power that are centralized across architectural history and criticism. Even more strikingly, the crux of the argument, and what Brown is inviting more scholars to explore, is the claim “that race is always shaped in some way by the built environment." [1] I wonder how this point around a spatial turn occurring in the humanities - wherein scholars consider the interconnectedness of racial and spatial histories - can inform some of my questions about the architecture of Black theater and performance histories.</p>

     <h2> "... how, if at all, does the built environment call modalities of culture into being?"</h2>
        <p>In questioning the role that architecture plays in the production of Black performance culture, I wonder how, if at all, does the built environment call modalities of culture into being? How does the built environment mediate, reproduce, or abstract the conditions of Black public life across rural and urban landscapes? Play and performance are functional social categories to approach architectural history and theory, and I wonder how questions of labor can expand this body of work. The subjects of play and performance challenge the idea that the social and cultural aspects do not matter. They pull the body and its contexts into the sightline in a similar affective force that a labor lens produces. In thinking about the Black theater, in particular, there is much to consider around the production of Black performance labor alongside the associative roots of Black entertainment in this country before the turn of the twentieth century.</p>
