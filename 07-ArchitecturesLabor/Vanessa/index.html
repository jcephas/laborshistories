	<h3 style="margin-right: 200px; margin-left: 200px;padding-left: 20px;">Vanessa Gonzalez </h3>
	<p style="margin-right: 200px; margin-left: 200px;"> In this week’s readings the authors investigated how the production of buildings heavily relies on an unaccounted labor force. Even though various subjects are integral to the design, construction, and maintenance of a building, the work of laborers is easily made invisible as they are rendered as parts of the machine that delivers a final product. This reminded me of our week 10 readings, in which we were introduced to how representations of labor have been obscured through photos, paintings, and drawings. By either including, excluding, or framing the working body in particular ways, larger audiences that viewed these representations started to form ideals and social perceptions about who participates in the labor force and larger production market. Historically, the Architecture field has tended to represent firms as entities that are governed by a sole principal or a few partners, that think of, design, and create the final product. However, today it is a known reality that there are many subjects who are vital to the sustenance of an architecture firm. </p>

	<p style="margin-right: 200px; margin-left: 200px;">In Peggy Deamer’s chapter, she interrogates how given the fact that architects have failed to view themselves as workers, given the tension between designers as art producers versus laborers– which poses a threat to the field (62). I thought this tension was worth highlighting as it presents a paradoxical quality that requires some unpacking. Deamer offers a proposition to reposition the subject position of the architect. However, I do think that given the prerequisites that are required in order to become an architect, this might pose a point of friction when deeming them “workers.” Today, in the field or on site, does the subject position of an architect place them in a separate category versus the contractors? Given the legal obligations associated with the title, how can we resolve the tensions that exist between the social positions different trades have been defined by? </p>

	<p style="margin-right: 200px; margin-left: 200px; padding-top: 80px;"> Marges Bacon’s piece highlights how the formation of the FAECT reflected a joint union between blue collar workers and white collar professionals. The technical men that joined forces to advocate for higher wages and better labor conditions reflect how historically there have been instances in which different trades and “professionals” have worked together for a common purpose. However, I’m curious if such a social structure would prevail today as building practices seem to be extremely fragmented? </p>

	<p style="margin-right: 200px; margin-left: 200px;"> Bacon also notes how this union was significantly racially segregated and gendered (459). Since this holds true for many construction trades today, I am left wondering how this might also affect the field of architecture as the road to licensure reflects racial and gender disparities that divide the practice. In Adrienne Brown’s chapter, Brown highlights how race is shaped by the built environment (204). By looking at how skyscraper construction became sites where human agency came into question, as workers were viewed as the animal, human, or the mechanical objects, one can note how different subject positions are defined and stripped away from workers who are made and remade through the construction of the built environment (207). Can we say that the same thing occurs to the architects? </p>
