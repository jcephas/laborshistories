        <p><i>What is made invisible through the ever-changing permutations of architectural production to/from play, labor, work, art, creating, etc.?</i></p>
        <p>Plainly put by Deamer in “Work,” “[architects] don’t believe [they] do work” (Deamer 61). She asserts that architects frequently place their importance among that of doctors and lawyers, yet the produced, architectural object is too artful to be considered part of the “service sector” and lacking in commodity-ness to be considered work (61). This constant, confident oscillation between all that architecture is not forces those that perform this type of production to putter along within a deeply insufficient system. Predicated on defining themselves apart from other disciplines, practices, etc., Deamer asserts that architects’ basis for understanding design “[isolates] it from work,” stating that “architects design, constructors build; we do art, they do work” (61). She goes onto express that from this clear “class” distinction results an absence of resonance with organizing efforts for workers’ rights. This act of separation, as though done in an attempt to be perceived as undefinable, perpetuates the inability to see beyond this metaphorical facade.</p>
        
        <p>While the layman can easily determine the duties of a doctor or a lawyer, the abilities of architects are often conflated with engineers, project managers, or contractors as a result of architectural labor being isolated in this process. The labor input of architectural production is made invisible by the onus of its value being placed on the object output. Similarly, Brown discusses in “Erecting the Skyscraper, Erasing Race” how the large scale of skyscrapers had frequently been leveraged to erase the hands that created it. After attempting to homogenize the building’s audience under “nation, metropolis…family” and even “tribe,” Starrett describes the building process strategically without mention of race while subsuming the laborers’ contributions by strictly describing their actions, not their “physical characteristics” (Brown 210-211). This practice of erasure operates at a similar level in the flattening Deamer describes as fundamental in invisibilizing and devaluing architectural labor. She writes that reconfiguring this relationship by “[endorsing] the idea that our knowledge//service is spatial, material, and organizational innovation” could produce the momentum to alter compensation structures and battle the effects of this isolation (74).</p>

        <p>Whether a symptom or byproduct of this isolationist behavior, the invisibility of architectural labor, both at the professional and academic level, permits this “righteous ignorance” of their proximity to one another as laborers, allies, and agents of change (74). It is this same ignorance I fear underscores a lack of true encouragement for interdisciplinary study — one that creates footing in understanding housing policy, one that illuminates architects’ efforts to lobby on Capitol Hill, one that allows discussions on environmental justice to extend beyond “well, what can an architect actually do about this.” Where Bacon argues that organizations like the Federation of Architects, Engineers, Chemists, and Technicians (FAECT) offer more than just its “operation as a labor organization,” but it provides space for “political engagement and social practice” and a “site for architectural discourse,” she is practically drawing on the historic evidence of <i>agglomeration effects</i> with architects (Bacon 454). When gathered together, in some amount of proximity to one another not only as architects, but also as knowledge-workers alongside those in other disciplines, idea-sharing takes place at a much higher rate and can productively facilitate discussions regarding new building techniques and fair wages. If architectural education forced <i>this</i> history to be at the forefront of its historical surveys in conjunction with formal theories and the “lone architects” that introduced them, perhaps the proper tension could arise to productively fracture this seemingly lonely discipline. Organizing is in direct opposition to ideological, professional, academic, etc. isolation, and as Deamer implores, architecture is long overdue in “[needing] to shed its work-aphasia and identify as an organization of workers” (Deamer75).</p>
