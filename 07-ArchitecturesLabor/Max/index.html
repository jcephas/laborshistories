			<p>Peggy Deamer’s call for architects to remake the profession’s relationship to its own labor entails, first, architects recognizing themselves as workers and then, more importantly, reimagining what it means to be a 21st-century architectural worker according to the creativity and utopianism already undergirding most architectural practices. Initially forging architects’ identification with work means disintegrating the pernicious myth that architectural design is not work.<a href="#Reference1"><sup>1</sup></a>  By curbing architecture’s “work-aphasia,” Deamer suggests that designers realize new ways of organizing themselves for better working conditions and greater agency over their labor.<a href="#Reference2"><sup>2</sup></a>  Deamer insists on the practicality of this by asserting that since artists have recognized their labor, architects can too. Illustrating this argument through a canon of highly paid blue-chip artists associated with exhibitions curated by the French art historian Nicolas Bourriaud in the 1990s under the theme of “Relational Aesthetics,” Deamer concludes that architectural work, like artwork, “functions within a system of value that can be toyed with.” While Deamer’s later evocation of Jacques Rancière’s “aesthetic regime” convincingly summarizes the idea that creative labor can radically transform the limits of political action, I believe re-envisioning architecture’s relationship to its own labor requires moving beyond models of creativity valorized by both corporate thought leaders and cultural connoisseurs.<a href="#Reference3"><sup>3</sup></a>  Rather than modeling architecture on the corporate management speak of Peter Drucker or the products of successful international artists, architects should instead form solidarity with other practitioners – like the studio assistants who actually produce “Relational Aesthetics” artists’ works – in order to overturn capitalist society’s ideological investments in mystical notions of creativity. This, I believe, would be more in keeping with the powerful intervention of Deamer’s text.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="bodytext2">
			<p>The Federation of Architects, Engineers, Chemists, and Teachers (FAECT) offers a historical example of how such a solidarity amongst technical workers from diverse professions might radically alter the conditions of labor. While the architectural historian Mardges Bacon’s analysis of the FAECT as a “site of architectural discourse” inadvertently amplifies the voices of canonical designers such as Buckminster Fuller or Frank Lloyd Wright, she nonetheless underscores the political power of an association comprising a broad swath of creative workers.<a href="#Reference4"><sup>4</sup></a>  Rather than exercise romantic Schillerian notions of creativity, as Deamer calls for, FAECT workers intervened into the legal regulations governing workers’ relations to their labor. As New Deal era public works projects sought to compartmentalize and differentiate the professions through the implementation of standards – recalling Cedric Robinson’s assertion that capitalism tends towards diversification, not homogenization – the FAECT’s coalition of workers successfully advocated against low wages and other oppressive conditions.<a href="#Reference5"><sup>5</sup></a>  The aesthetic regime disrupted by FAECT workers was bureaucratic rather than artistic. </p>
		</div>
		<div id="bodytext3">
			<p>To revolutionize architecture’s aesthetic regime so that designers more easily view themselves as workers in solidarity with other workers doing similar jobs entails a critique of what constitutes architectural production. Adrienne Brown demonstrates how historical accounts of skyscraper construction that emphasized the visuality of bigness occluded racialized constructions of labor.<a href="#Reference6"><sup>6</sup></a>  In this case, the aesthetic possibilities of capitalism and white supremacy ultimately limited how architecture could be understood. Toggling down one’s perspective, as Brown demonstrates, surfaces architecture’s entwinement with race. This is exactly what Deamer proposes by shifting the emphasis of architectural labor from “object-making” to “process.”<a href="#Reference7"><sup>7</sup></a>  As a political, intellectual, and, I believe, an aesthetic project, such a radicalization of architectural labor must be based on a rejection of post-Fordist corporate mentalities that seek to absorb the mythical avant-garde as a model for contemporary knowledge work.</p>
