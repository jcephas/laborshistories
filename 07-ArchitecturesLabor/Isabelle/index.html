		<h1>I</h1>
		<p>Deamer’s concept of “work-aphasia” explains the failure of architects to conceptualize their “work as work” (61). The nature of contemporary architectural labor then is defined by the separation of its production from a work process, which takes place within an organization of workers that should be compensated for their labor-time and the value of their object- and knowledge production. Deamer draws distinctions between architectural labor and other forms of artistic/creative practice (still hinged to issues of work/labor, value, and money). This identifies a particular valorization of cultural cache (or cultural capital), stemming from the aesthetic object or its form-making <i>rather than</i> the knowledge that produces it.</p>

		<h1>II</h1>
		<p>However, Bacon’s article on FAECT reveals that the “reconception of compensation” that Deamer argues for, or the viability of that political engagement, is ultimately bounded by organizational and structural concerns precisely tied to the management of technical knowledge. As a “usable past,” FAECT witnesses a historical moment in which architecture was aligned with New Deal labor, political struggle, and activism. Nonetheless, the disparate effects on labor it engendered (the actual inclusion of women and African Americans for example) brings to bear the entrenched bureaucratic and administrative mechanisms in which architectural labor is situated. This raises a question of how to valorize the labor of architectural workers—in a process different than the valorization Marx describes under capitalism. If “we” (architects) begin to identify as an organization of workers (tied to issues of labor), is there a possibility (the utopian and optimistic horizon) of finding freedom in our work?</p>

		<h1>III</h1>
		<p>Brown’s introduction offers an oblique answer through the work of scholarship—that is, liberatory potential is bound up in an interdisciplinary project that not only belongs to architecture but to other scholars and historians. Questions of labor rarely appear in architectural histories—to which, we might add questions of racialized labor. Brown’s work reveals that “labor histories” or the work of architectural historiography is not just about recovering the influence of ideology on architectural design and history, but also how those ideologies and identities are fundamentally shaped and constructed by the built environment/space. Brown’s work also complicates the question of finding freedom in work by foregrounding ideas we have previously discussed on the imaging and imagining of (racialized) labor, or “the representational riddle of the worker,” who is conceived of simultaneously as many things—abstracted surplus, less-than-human, machine, and catalyst for revolutionary proletarian organizing. Here, I found Brown’s references to Anne Cheng really interesting—because they explore how racialized personhood (to perceive race and feel raced) is ontologized through the laboring body as a kind of ornament: a synthetic personhood between human and object that is a crime (Loos). This aestheticization (the shoring up of aesthetic value to be made consumable and disposable) casts marginalized bodies “outside” or “beyond” (non)relation to architecture, “overlooking how race gets constructed in these very performances of non-relation” (217). To connect this to architecture’s labor and the work labor histories of architecture might reveal, architectural work is similarly aestheticized (to go back to Deamer)—so much so that injury cannot be attributed at the same time that aestheticization invites exploitation.</p>
