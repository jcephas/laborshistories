				<h1>Working Class Bodies</h1>
				<p>Despite the extraordinarily brute and facile distinctions about bodily dispositions (more or less unsupported by convincing evidence), Mauss’ study on the techniques of the body does offer an interesting perspective on the body as an assemblage of socio-pyscho-biological actions/processes. For me, this situates the body in equivalences that are constitutively and fundamentally shaped by various spaces—physical, psychic, and social environments in which the human subject and body labors. Kuskey’s call for a materialist theory of the working body locates a crucial gap between an individual’s own bodily lived experience and its abstracted status, whereby the labor it produces is translated into deviance, lost wages, and trauma (perhaps like the “nervous work” of Slavishak’s later chapter) made calculable or measurable against the capacity of that abstracted body to project profits. In such a site of class struggle, Baron and Boris front a question of embodiment (of how labor is embodied). To write an “embodied working class history” would mean attending to foundational assumptions about the working body and the historical processes in which it has been made. Class is made manifest through bodily dispositions that package dynamics of difference. Embodied labor points to the discursive, epistemic regimes that have privileged some bodies over others—for example, the contests over bodily representations of work and the practices employed to aesthetically manage or control laboring bodies, which Slavishak writes about in both chapters—and specifically, in the spectacular representations of labor on display in the boosterist project of civic image-making even in the actual absence of work or the working body itself. 
				</p>
				<p>But across the readings this week, I found myself particularly interested in how the body comes to be ambiguously coded and marked. For example, Slavishak examines how the immigrant, female body was defined against the bodily spectacle of Pittsburgh and stratified in reformist surveys like Butler’s in order to uphold the socially reproductive role of women in sustaining the familial structures capitalism relies on. In such instances, the human subject is a body, but that body appears (at times) almost never “human” to begin with, vacillating in the hybridity or blurriness between what is “real” and what is “false” or prostheses (machine), as social and class categorizations attempt to grasp at an empty or emptied “identity” (and this perhaps pushes us towards tricky questions about ontology). This body—neither object or subject but <i>resource</i>—seems to engender a double-bind in which it sustains the state and capital at the same time as is its life seemingly threatens its flourishing. And this working (class) body is extra-visible, but it is defined by its capacity (or incapacity) to withstand the hurt or harm of labor. So to lean on our previous conversations on the fragmented body, perhaps the fantasy of a white, male, working body and desires for an immigrant surface or flesh emptied of interiority share common origin.

				<h1>Racialized Labor</h1>
				<p>I’d like to begin with a critical take, synthesized from this week’s readings: race is not a chimera of false (class) consciousness but a historical trajectory or constellation of trajectories organized around permeable boundaries of identity formation; this has malleably shaped the “working class” and the mechanisms of finance and capital fueled by its labor in order to maintain and support (to fit into) a (White) ruling class (or its supremacy).</p> 	
				<p>From Robinson, we learn that there is no such thing as “non-racial” capitalism—that is, racial capitalism is not a <i>type</i> of capitalism; rather, the general history of capitalism developed within a racial regime. He demonstrates this by showing how European racism preceded capitalism, which challenges the Marxist idea of capitalism (and the Hegelian understanding of history we have discussed) as a revolutionary break from feudalism. Instead, capitalism emerges from an extension of the same forces, evolving from a feudal order to produce the “larger tapestry of the modern world’s political and economic relations,” which rests on a colonial project of dispossession, settlement, expropriation, genocide, and racial hierarchy (e.g., the racial ideology of <i>Herrenvolk</i>). As Robinson argues: “the tendency of European civilization through capitalism was thus not to homogenize but to differentiate—to exaggerate regional, subcultural, and dialectical differences into ‘racial’ ones” (26). Thus, the first European proletarian subjects were racial subjects and their identities were fashioned and embedded within Europe. This principle feature, to which is inextricably linked modern forms of nationalism, posits the “rational” structure of the state in a world system—an international system of domination, where the <i>seeming</i> universality of capitalism extends from its ability to construct a language or logic built into bureaucratic state structures as a conduit for expansion (as its machinery of rule). Since I’ve already risked diving way too far into Robinson, all of this is to say how the existence of the “bourgeois” and its survival was constructed out of the capitalization of racial difference. To connect this to the other readings, the management of the white working class and the control of the “lower orders” are suspended in this web of power, the orchestration and instrumentalities of the state, as it weaves into its order racialized and privileged identities (cutting across free and unfree labor; waged and unwaged/reproductive work) to maintain the human and inhuman resources required to sustain its accumulation and its social and spatial divisions.</p>
				<p>Jones calls attention to the significance of examining these lower orders/subordinate classes as a method to contest the narrative arc of the transition of “slavery to freedom” in American and southern history (shifting focus beyond the exclusive study of black workers by labor historians). This method is perhaps best exemplified by Roediger’s chapter on the prehistory of the white worker; its focus on the development of “white” identity (e.g., the free/man and its freedom/independence) offers a framework for understanding how Black subjects were formed as the antithesis to the White republican citizen post-Revolution. This approach seems to unsettle the concept of the “working class” from Marx or at least the romanticized agency attributed to it in order to consider, instead, the subjectivity of a particular working class and the identities from which those subjects are hailed.</p>
				<p>Trotter’s chapter almost exclusively focuses on the black working class, and in this way, it might make for an easy comparison against Jones and Roediger’s texts. However, rather than rubbing against that method, I see it as a different angle into why and how free wage-earning Black workers were dispossessed by White competition, restrictive labor legislation, and the white-led African recolonization movement. It also offers a fundamental account of the lives and livelihoods of a Black working class and how these workers built and shaped the preindustrial city—evidencing how these populations persisted and survived despite or in spite of the new social order, the naturalized pathologies that marked their bodies for laborious work, and the institutionalization of such racialized class and identity positions of labor and work.</p>
				<p>Lastly, a really meaningful (yet maybe obvious) intervention and contribution I find in Jay’s piece is its emphasis on landscape and space and its relationship to the racialized working body and the livelihood of workers. Just as the body bears and performs the codified marks of race, so too does the landscape. This space and environment is not just the backdrop or setting of racial subordination but the <i>very means</i> through which the racialization of labor is constructed, imagined, and consumed (and through which agriculture and infrastructure was produced). Carceral institutions, institutions of punishment, and organized abandonment are also highlighted here. So to abruptly end with a messy thought: if the construction of a laboring (Black) body is often threatened by and defined against another body (usually White) in the same context, how has the state managed to find legal language to sanction the erosion of full benefits of citizenship, the privilege to be a subject in the body politic while upholding so-called liberal democracy? Part of this question stems from the social construction of other racial differences that have also upheld the White worker position—for instance, how Native and Asian bodies have historically been “othered” to become a model rather than a negative reference point (the former is mentioned in Roediger). This straddling at the limits of law not only seems to foreground the mistaken use of the “nation” as a transhistorical social and economic category but also brings to bear the kind of “care” through which shifting identities at the intersection of race, class, and labor are organized—and where those bodies are often debilitated in the name of care for the functioning of state.</p>

				<h1>Imagining Labor</h1>
				<p>Erika Doss’ text begins with a commonplace assumption that what we do represents who we are. This idea links work and labor to identity, the form and figure of which is communicated by the images and imaginations associated with working bodies and spaces of labor. Alongside the visual coding of the American male body (Doss), the absence of historical documents left by individual Chinese railroad workers (Khor), and the erasure of labor for ecology or efficiency in architectural drawings of food production (TenHoor), I reflected on the slipperiness of personhood and the vulnerability of its value in imagining labor, particular in relation to our final projects.</p> 	
				<p>Doss, on the one hand, reveals the uniform and universal declarations of New Deal iconography meshed with political ideologies like the techno-optimism of corporate capitalism (thus helping to maintain its patterns of management and control). On the other, the existence of “oddball” images (the protest pieces, for example) contests “official” assumptions of work and workers to reveal different social attitudes that challenge the dominance of propagandistic idioms of heroism and work ethic. Both nonetheless emphasize a central point: the crisis of identity, or the crisis in stabilizing its representation and value in relation to work. Imaginations of labor attempt to grasp at this meaning through work, its bodies and spaces. In examples of the “partially clad or partially nude” male working body, this crisis is aestheticized into a model: the gendered and racialized body shaped by and belonging to long histories of the ideal Western human form (60). Spaces of labor are merely background for this aesthetic fixation, whereby the body is coded with tropes of labor from a mythical past and its flesh consumed and valorized as a dehumanized and sexualized object. In this process, real issues of labor and capitalist surplus value production are displaced. To fold space and the built environment back into this discussion, TenHoor describes how issues and conditions of labor are removed in the architectural drawings of food production. Labor, particularly the working body and its conditions, is ignored at the same time as it is displaced on to other aesthetic dimensions, namely the diagrammatic and spatial logics of efficiency and ecology and the sensual pleasure of engaging in artisanal and hipster food production. To “imagine” labor then in architectural drawing and design fronts methodological questions about how to attend to real working conditions while experimenting with new ways to identify and represent labor. </p>
				<p>To conclude, I’d like to end with Khor’s invitation to probe a series of methodological questions on historical evidence, historiography, and the archive in relation to a digital humanities project, the CRRW Digital Archive, which considers photographs that visually document Chinese workers yet reveal little of their personhood. Given these records of marketability and the majestic and technological sublime, I found Khor’s emphasis on the “absence of text,” “the inability to identify,” “namelessness,” and what “remains missing” as methodologically, historically, and theoretically significant and meaningful. Khor’s personal and subjectively framed approach to labor (something also present in Doss’ writing) describes how we might productively make use of absence in considering a digital archive. The way labor “looks” ultimately captures contradictory potentials for our examination of space and subjectivity and the visualization of this investigation: while it offers a site for understanding the dynamic, sometimes ambivalent constructions of the laboring subject, it also comprises the aesthetic consumption of lived experiences of labor and life. This tension also excavates issues on the digitization of information, for example its “overproduction” and the challenges of producing a “usable past” (Khor, 439) and engendering new political and ethical engagements capable of addressing concrete issues of labor.</p>
