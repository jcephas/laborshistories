	ARC550 Reading Response 06<br>
	April 28, 2023</p>
<p>If nothing else, the previous weeks have helped to frame the omnipresence of labor in a fraught relationship with the myriad ways in which it might be represented. In our readings on various modes of “imag(in)ing labor” we saw that bodies make for difficult subjects through which labor can be imaged and imagined: either idealized to the point of vacuity (as in the artworks Erica Doss examines) or erased in favor of visual evidence of their work (as Denise Khor describes), visualizing the body is simultaneously a profitable and a problematic site of representation. A similar problematic seems to be at play when we scrutinize the relationship between architecture and labor. On the one hand, architecture is as potent a site through which to think and envision labor as the body; on the other, this week’s readings show architecture—the theoretical framing of its creative and intellectual practices (as Peggy Deamer considers), the institutionalized practice of designing (as in the organization Madges Bacon discusses), and the realities of how architecture is constructed (as Adrienne Brown confronts)—to be similarly subject to modes of evasion and obfuscation. </p>

<div id="section02" class="second">
<p>We come into this week with several pressing framing questions. Peggy Deamer offers the most salient guide to (re)thinking several of these, namely the very nature of architectural labor—a labor that is, Deamer argues from the outset, obfuscated by the architect’s failure to “conceptualize our work as work” (Deamer 61). While I agree with Deamer that the visual arts has a long and strong history of “probing the thin line” between artistic labor and an art about labor (Deamer 67), I would qualify this claim in several ways. The practices and theories Deamer points to are paradigmatically modern, emergent out of an anxiety surrounding the bourgeois art object’s status in an increasingly mechanized, regimented, alienated world. In my view architecture was faced with a very different existential crisis. Rather than litigate its relevance in an age of mechanical reproduction, and thus negotiate for its very existence (as in the case of artistic labor), architecture design became increasingly divested from the labor of its construction thanks to the selfsame technologies. </p>

<div id="section03" class="third">
<p>This is illustrated in Madges Bacon’s discussion of the Federation of Architects, Engineers, Chemists, and Technicians (FAECT) roughly contemporaneous with some of Bertold Brecht’s best-known works of Epic Theater Deamer notes as negating “the divisions between author and actor, actors and stage-hands, and actors/stage-hands and audience” (Deamer 65): in the case study of FAECT confronting the potential of prefabricated housing, architecture’s engagement with technologies of reproduction and mass-production destabilized the relationship between the laborer—the “workers who became employed as a result of the growth” of such new technologies—and the product of their labor, the increasingly sophisticated prefabricated dwelling (Bacon 460). With organizations like FAECT to mediate between the drive to produce and the need to provide, we are offered a rare opportunity to scrutinize the growing gulf between design and construction. </p>

</div>


<div id="section03" class="four">

	Adrienne Brown’s description of William A. Starrett’s Skyscrapers and the Men who Built Them is another perspective on this gulf: in rendering the production of the skyscraper as a “romantic masculine adventure (Brown 209),” replete with a suite of “folk heroes (Brown 210)” (read: white, male architects) and a personal connection which displaces non-white, non-idealized bodies on the construction site. Brown’s discussion of Starrett’s book reminds us that architecture’s growing preoccupation with its own self-fashioning has perpetuated the fallacy of the absence of race and the primacy of one “heroic” role in architectural production. <br> This is all to say: in being reminded of the ways in which architecture has, to paraphrase Deamer, failed to recognize that its work is work, we are also forced to reflect on the ways in which the same impulse has jettisoned other forms of labor from discussions on the field. Where the body always comes before and is integral to labor, labor comes before and is integral to architecture. In both cases—that of understanding how the complexities of representing the laboring body, and of confronting the ways in which architectural discourses have obfuscated the role of labor and overlooked its various forms—understanding these casual relationships will help us better understand the ways in which these trajectories of obfuscation, oversight, and forgetting become possible.  </p>
