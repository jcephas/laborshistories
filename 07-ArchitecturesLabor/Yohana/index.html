<h1>Reading Response 06: Yohana Ansari-Thomas</h1>

<p class="paragraph">

The known unknown of a “play-oriented side of work [that] can wreak havoc on the existing [capitalist] system”<span class="footnote"><sup>1</sup></span><span class="hide">1. Deamer, Peggy, ed. <i>The Architect as Worker: Immaterial Labor, the Creative Class, and the Politics of Design</i>. London: Bloomsbury Publishing Place, 2015, 70.</span> requires scrutiny over where the line is drawn, if at all, between work and play. Might the two concepts require distinct shapes in order to offer social reproduction? To put it another way, how would the existing models of social reproduction transform or dissolve in the wake of a work-play system after capitalism? By framing architectural work as a higher calling, work and play are already bound together. The work-play merger, at least in this current problematic form, enables employers to demand unmitigated hours.

In comparison, the unknown knowns of architectural labor, to borrow from Zizek in response to Rumsfeld, lie in its power to shape race, class, ideology, etc. This historical resistance to acknowledge the unknown known appears in both pieces by Marges Bacon and Adrienne Brown. Both authors point to the class and racial anxieties that influenced the evolution of the building industry. We’ve come to understand the technological development and subsequent ubiquity of concrete and steel production as an intentional motivation of 19th century architects to limit and remove agency from the artisan-builder. Brown’s brief mention of Loos gets at this squarely, however her critique of William Starrett’s monograph reveals the critical role narrative plays in constructing the problematic of the architect as an entity that operates beyond labor. Heritage and belonging are key components that Brown pulls from Starrett’s narrative. A similar transformation or attachment of heritage and belonging to a commodity-informed labor occurs in the production of the Kashmiri shawl. Thus, it would seem these are tried-and-true insidious methods.

 Furthermore, Bacon’s handling of the Bulletin and Technical America articles provides insight into how postwar-era politics and anxieties were weaponized to undermine labor organizations’ mobility. Bacon’s multiple mentions of Buckminster Fuller as an architect and writer who took interest in technological development, social issues, and the relationship between the two is particularly intriguing. Fuller’s belief in nth-degree-optimized automation as a means to exit living-wage work altogether perhaps misses the point that Ranciere would later underline: that the constricted nature of the workers’ lives is the conflict of the proletariat as opposed to work in of itself.<span class="footnote"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="hide">2.
