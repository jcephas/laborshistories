			In this week’s readings the authors explored how different representational techniques have yielded working bodies as visible or invisible. The production of photographs, drawings, paintings, and other artistic mediums were interrogated in order to understand how systems of representation have become embedded within societies that have consequently molded values and identities. Doss’ piece highlighted how the white working male body became a symbol of maleness during the 1930s, as artistic representations (ie: paintings) of the male body became “objects of the American gaze” (64). Though Doss’ analysis does proffer a critical lens that acknowledges the hierarchical and discriminatory nature of Depression Era aestheticized representations of work, I found the piece a bit limiting as its primary model subject defaults to the white working male. Though Doss briefly mentions how certain races and classes have been marginalized through their depictions, such as Native Americans, her analysis does not offer much insight into how non-white societies and laborers had created own ideals, models, and representational mediums that painted a different picture of American society at large (64). I am curious how these depictions of other subjects might offer different readings of labor during this time period? 

			<p>	On the other hand, Khor’s piece does offer specific methodologies that have been employed by scholars that are interested in unveiling archival silences. The Chinese Railroad Workers in North America Project use of diverse archival materials reflects intents to understand expanded narratives of labor that are many times blurry, and not as clearly defined as in Doss’ piece. Even though the materials Khor references such as photos did not originate directly from Chinese workers, they offer an alternative perspectives on how reading in between the lines of photography can help understand a particular space and time. Khor’s investigation of the mass representation of Chinese workers in photos takes on the job of remembering a past that many times has been obscured by historical accounts that frame particular narratives of American modernization. The use of photos by railroad companies that recorded the laborers but did not acknowledge them as individual subjects, rather as parts of their projects, presents a representation of labor which Khor reads against in order to expand understandings of the transcontinental railroad system. Khor’s approach mirrors Tenhoor’s argument that calls for a better understanding of the subjects that produce spatial systems such as architecture and infrastructures (such as railroads). Based on these last two readings, it seems as if the author’s would agree that the representation of these subjects within visual culture would allow for consumers to engage with what has historically been made invisible. However, I am left wondering if and how new representations through different mediums (ie:digital, renderings, ec) might create distanced readings that alienate the workers from their contexts? </p>
