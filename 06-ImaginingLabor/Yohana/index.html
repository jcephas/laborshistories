        In Doss’s analysis of early 20th century representations of labor, she reads the layered codes imposed onto the mythical body as emblematic of broader post-WWI anxieties. The images situate one’s identity in close proximity to their labor, typically represented through didactic ideas of virility. Ultimately, through the circulation of this ecology of images into the public sphere, the consistent presence of the male body in these representations reproduces violent atmospheres of labor that seem to call into existence a particular kind of laboring body that is definitive and masculine in shape. As she compares the construction of the male body and the working body between the 1930s and the1990s (and we might extend into a third comparison that captures the first two decades of the 21st century), she briefly touches on the racial politics which underscore how the assumptions of whiteness in constructing ideas of masculine labor are rendered explicitly in their representations.<sup>1</sup> This relies on the presence of a white figure in each representation. Doss’ analysis which requires her to read what the image does not represent against the grain of what it does begs the question: <a href="javascript:;" onClick="document.getElementById('text').style.opacity=0;">what consequences emerge when the subject is entirely removed from the representation of their labor?</a>

        Khor and TenHoor can similarly be understood through this framing of the discrepancies between what is and is not represented in labor imagination, and how the two are inseparably related as negotiations of power and identity politics. When read through this dichotomous relationship, Khor’s point on the misspelling or omission of names all together reveals the manner in which the subjectivity of the Chinese worker is constructed through its archive as a half-existence; their lack of representation suggests they will not be able to be fully located within an historical memory. Furthermore, the physical distance of the photographer from the subjects in the photographs shown render the subjects’ shape as partially obscured or abstracted. This, too, implicates the archive as a political tool of racialized power dynamics, since the Chinese workers are not given the kind of attention that the figures are given in Doss’s examples. Regardless of the medium of representation, be it architectural illustration, painting, or photograph, the detail of the subject (or lack thereof) pulls into conversation the aforementioned negotiations of power in labor imagination.

        Lastly, TenHoor’s criticism of the architect’s screen as the literal and figurative barrier from the realm of food production suggests a desire to reject capitalist logics of representation that promote quantifiable optimization. These drawings, she argues, fail to grasp the material and qualitative aspects that produce a kind of unmeasurable evidence of labor and knowledge.<sup>2</sup> That said, when TenHoor suggests we represent labor in architectural drawings, it is unclear how the architect might embrace that and to what degree they can incorporate human labor within certain types of drawings outside the logistic diagram. Perhaps this is because the architectural drawing is often made legible only in relation to other drawings (triangulation). However, the current aesthetic regard to represent the ground as a single line (for example) certainly abstracts land to the violent degree that it bears no trace of labor whatsoever. Can her critique of labor in architectural drawing extend beyond the logistic drawing to address the orthographic projection? As another example, what agency can construction drawings produce in representing futurity within the technical document–a labor yet to be performed?
