				Each of the readings for this week tackles the issues that arise when imaging labour, whether those are the socioeconomic inequities reflected in the photographs of the Chinese railroad workers in the mid- to late-nineteenth century (Khor); the anxieties about the development of the US labour economy during the New Deal (Doss); or the question of how to account for existing processes of labour in the diagramming of more efficient food systems (TenHoor). The texts deal with fundamentally different genres of image, from oil paintings (Doss), to stereoscopic photograph (Khor), and diagram (TenHoor), but, in all cases, the persistent preoccupation is with what is left out. No matter the reality-status of the referent (a staged, imagined or potentially ‘ideal’ worker in Doss’s article; a real but unidentified and dehumanised labourer in Khor’s article; or an anticipated worker in TenHoor’s piece), these readings all stress the fact that images fail to tell the whole story, subverting the received wisdom that <em>a picture is worth a thousand words</em>.

				Erika Doss’s exploration of the idealised and unclothed man-labourer as a topos in New-Deal-era art stresses the crisis of masculinity and rapidly evolving labour landscape that undergirds this aestheticisation of manual labour. The homoerotic under-/over-tones of much of this art have prompted me to consider some crucial distinctions between the depiction of labourers in the USA and USSR of the same period. Though Socialist Realism coexists in time with the art of the New Deal and exhibits the same proclivity for the man-labourer as a neoclassical evolution of its Greco-Roman roots, here, totally topless workers are simply not present. The blonde-haired and big-muscled factory-working members of the Soviet proletariat wear white shirts with blue aprons. Rarely, the white shirt is omitted, but the apron always remains and nipples are never visible. Interestingly, while women-workers do not enjoy the same levels of representation in Socialist Realism, they are even more likely to be clothed than men. This is particularly striking given that one of the key scenarios in which women are depicted as ‘working’ is in breastfeeding; yet they feed with curiously non-sexualised breasts (almost like udders) which almost do not appear to have nipples even in the informational posters directed to women about the care of their nipples. In this way, Doss’s articles draws our (or, at least, has drawn my) attention to what idealised representations of labourers belie in terms of the sets of relationships (both social and political) those bodies are imagined to have. Hypermasculinity might both allow and deny homosocial desire in the art of the US New Deal, but, in the USSR, it is also a primary symbolic vehicle in the erasure of eros (but not eroticised bodies) from the public sphere.

			<p>
				In Denise Khor’s article, we find the most pressing engagement with the material medium of the image. This is for a number of reasons: the lack of written records about the Chinese railroad labourers; the corresponding contemporary presupposition that photography was not for the documentation of the labourers; but nonetheless, the ways in which the photographs can now be read by modern viewers in conjunction with other documents perhaps against the intentions of their maker. There is also an interesting question of authorship raised in the article which reflects the extent to which our perceptions have changed towards the artistic status of photography, in that, where photographs were once imagined to be the privileged ‘embalming’ of a decontextualised reality (André Bazin), we increasingly interpret photographs as being shot both ways, such that they reflect not a stable identity of sign (photograph) and referent (reality) that continues in perpetuum, but rather a snapshot of a single moment of the dynamic and ongoing relationship between the photograph-maker and the photographed-entities, both of which are imprinted in some respect on the photograph itself. Crucially, Khor’s article debunks our assumptions of photography as an objective medium and emphasises the ways in which its very non-objectivity can serve as the basis for archive-building especially when put in constellation with other sources.

			<p>
				In Meredith TenHoor’s piece, the question of how to account for labour in diagrams restructuring the spaces and relations of food distribution is equally a call for architects to engage in the pre-existing material and human conditions of the environments in which they hope to work. This strikes me as a highly relevant point in so far as social reproduction theory is concerned, in that capitalism is often most effective in those instances in which it can harness the activity of an existing group of people, rather than attempting to create its workers from scratch. There is a way in which the innovation capitalism claims to promote is fundamentally at odds with the efficiency towards which it strives. Of course, there is also an ethical dimension to this, in so far as TenHoor seems to be suggesting that it is the responsibility of the architect as the most abstracted and privileged worker of the built environment (with, nominally, the most control over the environment) to safeguard the livelihood of those workers most concretely (financially and socially) embedded in it (but with least authority over it).
