		<p class=indent>This week’s readings help illuminate the ways in which images of labor may be read, presented/re-presented, and mobilized to contemporary social and political ends. I’m particularly interested in the methods of reading images presented by Denise Khor, who closely reads photographs of Chinese railroad workers attending to the historical conditions not only of the economic development of a settler colonial nation, but also in terms of the geographical, geological, and climatic conditions that Chinese laborers worked in. By attending closely to the planetary in conjunction with the toil of outdoor labor in the 19th century, while also situating Chinese labor in the american landscape and keeping in mind their descendants, Khor resurfaces the ways in which the <b>work</b> of landscape construction is not only political and economic, but also deeply material. The human and the geologic combine, tying family genealogies to specific sites of labor; in Khor’s attendance to the individual stories of Chinese railroad labor mined from the archival images, her act of connecting living descendants to the sites of their laboring ancestors is a particularly important aspect of this project. Furthermore, these connections were only made possible by creating such an archive, as Khor and her team’s collection of heterogeneous documents help to create a fuller picture of both the labor produced by 19th century american conditionality and the individuated stories of personhood and subjective experience that the racialized prescription of labor too often obscures. </p>

		<p class=indent>This practice of connecting laboring bodies to personhood, while humanistic in the historical sense, is drawn to contemporary productive frameworks in Meredith TenHoor’s work proposing alternative modes of labor representation that might exist in architectural production. By focusing on the ways in which food, productive labor, and architecture/infrastructure are unified but unevenly prioritized, TenHoor implicitly criticizes the existing political economy of food through its labor representations. Ultimately, TenHoor argues, by “designing and drawing food infrastructures can help us imagine new forms of fairness and new realms of satisfaction…the representation of our logistical drawings might identify and represent both the agonism and the opportunities that new infrastructures can yield.”<sup>1</sup> The simple act of representing the labor that would inhabit the architectural designs in question draws to the fore the experiences, desires, and modes of life of farm workers that could radically alter the social practices of food production in society. Of course, architecture won’t save us, and representing labor in design is not the same as the active production of agency that organized labor offers. However, by looking to architectural production as the production of potentiality and its archives, such practices offer strategies to reimagining the oppressive histories and capitalist hierarchies that would otherwise prioritize efficiency over labor experience.

		<p class=indent>Ultimately, as Erika Doss articulates in “Toward an Iconography of American Labor,” the aesthetic question of the ideal human form is one that has subtle yet immense political resonances in the hegemonic ordering of society. Contradictions arise when comparing representations of the worker against representations of the “savage”; nudity here becomes racialized. While semi-nude representations of Native Americans offered images of backwardness and savagery, semi-nude representations of white working bodies in industrial contexts represented a white nation’s proud growth. However, the changing ways in which representation of labor is politicized highlights a break in social cohesion that might be grasped and reoriented, as in TenHoor’s proposal and in Khor’s project.
