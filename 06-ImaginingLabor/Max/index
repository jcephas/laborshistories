			<p>Erika Doss provides a cultural archaeology of the American worker, uncovering deposits of semi-nude laboring men with bulging muscles in imagery, both popular and elite, spanning the early 19th century through the Great Depression. Ultimately, Doss argues that such images not only reflected the ideologies of corporate capitalism which sought to promote hard, often dangerous, industrial labor as virtuous, but that images of idealized male laborers also acted as imaginative prophylactics against workers’ “vulnerability” (Doss 1997, 64). In many of the artworks Doss analyzes, pictures of powerful, heroic men toiling at industrial production function as apotropaic symbols mounted against new contingencies such as macroeconomic shocks like the Depression, challenges to the status of men as the sole breadwinners in families, and the diminishing importance of supposedly masculine qualities like physical strength in modern workplaces (Doss 1997, 55, 66). Doss emphasizes that artworks produced through New Deal cultural programs coincided with the “deep-felt anxieties of nonworking males, for whom labor had been the primary form of identity,” which she takes as grounds to suggest that artists depicted proud homosocial bodies to “sustain a sense of the masculine self” (Doss 1997, 62).</p> 
			<p>Doss rethinks conventional accounts that understand these images as coming from above, as ideological tools used by capitalists and the state to control a despairing labor force. Instead, Doss positions the iconology of “beefcake” laborers during the 1930s and 40s as an expression of working-class artists in the face of crises over the status of white masculinity. This intervention takes New Deal Keynesianism seriously by interpreting artworks from the demand-side perspectives of everyday workers rather than the supply-side imperatives of corporations and capitalists. 
			<p>The Stanford Chinese Railroad Workers in North America Project (CRRW) similarly emphasizes grassroots historiography by making “publicly and freely available thousands of digital objects” from the Chinese workers who built the United States rail infrastructure during the second half of the 19th century (Khor 2016, 455). Denise Khor writes that the CRRW project will allow a more expansive network of researchers access to a digital archive of materials useful for writing histories that center on the previously occluded roles of Chinese laborers in building railroads. Rather than relying upon the conventional institutional structures of academic historiography, the CRRW project pursues “historical recovery” through “public participation and engagement” (Khor 2016, 432).</p>
			<p>Khor’s analysis of the photographs depicting Chinese railroad workers, particularly Alfred Hart’s “Laborers and Rocks,” reveals that historical recovery entails inverting the figure/ground relationship which is endemic to existing archives. Of Hart’s photographs Khor writes that Chinese workers’ “presence in the field of vision was often subsumed in relation to nature and the machine” (Khor 2016, 443). Just as it is necessary to tease the laboring bodies out from the landscapes in which they are pictorially embedded, the CCRW project calls for inverting the figures and grounds of history more generally; the project’s digital archive emphasizes the Chinese workers who built the nation’s railroads, a group of people who, as Khor describes, institutional repositories normally occlude (Khor 2016, 447).</p>
			<p>Meredith TenHoor’s polemic similarly urges greater emphasis on the individuals who labor within infrastructural networks. Addressing contemporary designers, TenHoor argues that abstract drawings of resource flows, ecological processes, and systemic interventions – frequent sights at design school final reviews as TenHoor was writing in 2015 – should not “diagram away” workers’ lives and livelihoods (TenHoor 2015, 141). Architectural images of complex relationships in which human labor is absented, at their most troubling for TenHoor, function like diagrammatic twists on Harry Sternberg’s three-part 1938 artwork Dance of the Machine, which Doss analyzes as depicting “male and female rank-and-file trapped – literally – in the cogs of big industry, manipulated by time clocks and big bosses” (Doss 1997, 60). As in Sternberg’s paintings, the “aesthetics of white-collar ecology” that weigh on TenHoor reduce workers’ bodies to hardware, metonymically indissociable from their instrumentalization within capitalist production (TenHoor 2015, 142).</p>
			<p>In shifting narrative emphasis towards workers themselves, TenHoor, Khor, and Doss each employ a smaller, more human scale of historical analysis. TenHoor highlights the workers whose lives intersect with designed systems, Khor sharpens focus onto the previously blurry identities of Chinese railroad workers, and Doss interprets New Deal-era depictions of idealized laborers as expressions of working-class anxieties. Altogether, these texts suggest that open-source archival practices like the CCRW project can surface traces of human lives often overshadowed by larger narratives or institutional structures.</p>
