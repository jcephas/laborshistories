		<p>How people, places, or things are represented through artistic media can often carry a multitude of meanings, whether they are intend by the creator or imposed by its audience. When the significance of a photograph or portrait is steeped in the various contexts that allow its importance to be read through different lenses, these works can mobilize meanings extending beyond place and time. In “Toward an Iconography of American Labor: Work, Workers, and the Work Ethic in American Art, 1930-1945,” Doss describes the critical nature of the visual media that was created in the early 20th century and its impact on the perception of labor following the Great Depression. By utilizing a nude male figure as the subject of materials promoting the value and valor of laboring bodies, and therefore, labor itself, figures fashioned in this way could also symbolize support for war efforts <i>through</i> that connection to labor: “Even during World War I, that symbol persisted when artists such as Dean Cornell produced paintings aimed not at labor solidarity but at urging mass-industrial support for military mobilization” (Doss 60). Here she touches on the various ways that these figures can be perceived or staged to produce different outcomes through this “[devised] aesthetic vocabulary,” further suggesting the critical role that aesthetics can play when leveraged in association with messaging.</p>
		
		<p>Similarly, TenHoor discusses the correlation of aesthetics and meaning in her piece “Labor in the Logistical Drawing.” She describes the proliferation of images following the food shortage after World War II which centered buildings read first with ultimate efficiency in mind, such as “modern grain silos, slaughterhouses, milk cooperatives, and markets” (TanHoor 139). She connects this early 20th century fixation on efficiency with the same interest that exists today within architecture, as designs continue to aestheticize “supply and logistics chains,” while invisibilizing the presence of labor in pursuit of ultimate efficiency (140). Later, she connects this practice outright to a visual category, deeming these design moves “aesthetics of white-collar ecology — wherein designs produced from above yield systems that often look more appropriate as corporate organizational charts than as visions of autonomous production schemes” (142). The aesthetics that stand in place of the true labor that goes into food production mobilize a fabricated reality, one that places the <i>idea</i> of efficiency and its perceived value over that of those who labor through its creation.</p>

		<p>In “Archives, Photography, and Historical Memory,” Khor also describes the power of such images in adding value to the lands given to railroad companies during Western expansion. Specifically, the depiction of Chinese railroad workers, photographed in a highly staged manner, offered a “work of pure artifice” to be received as an indication of the labor taking place on grounds with potential or future value (Khor 450). Mixed in this staging, Khor notes in the specific image cited, “China Section Gang Promontory,” that the workers’ identities, as they are posed against the backdrop of a thoughtfully-framed “UPRR (Union Pacific Railroad) photograph wagon,” are effectively overshadowed and absorbed by this branding, as they are not Union Pacific workers (450). With the framing that Khor has provided, it forces a direct confrontation with the consideration of what this image might be without the workers; if only presented with a photograph of the landscape, how much of the landscape’s perceived value is lost? Perhaps, on the reverse end, one might consider whether the perceived value of the workers stands independently of or in direct correlation with their presence and proximity to this new, railroad technology within these photographs — if they are fundamental in this framing, not only their labor, but their physical presence could arguably be more valuable than the land itself prior to operation (where all the potential value would be held at this time). Overall, these three texts clearly define the gravitas of the transformation of image to iconography, as aesthetics can be leveraged either purposefully or passively to mobilize certain beliefs and influence individuals that confront them. </p>
