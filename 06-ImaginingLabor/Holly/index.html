<p> Reflecting on our discussion of “Working (Class) Bodies” several weeks ago in light of this week’s readings, I am struck by the ways in which these three texts allow us to further consider the body’s status as a charged site for representing (or, following the tendencies Meredith TenHoor points to, obscuring) broader motifs of labor and its social, political, and ideological connotations. In her comments on 19th century journalism and depictions of exploited, and often mutilated, factory laborers, Jessica Kuskey writes that such bodies were frequently “abstracted” into “statistics,” which in turn renders them quantifiable entities in service of class struggle <span style="color: red">(Kuskey 7-8)</span>. In Erika Doss’s discussion of 1930s American imagery of the muscular, often minimally-clad, proto-”Soloflex” bodies of (almost always male) laborers underscores a very different type of abstraction: they reveal a fantasy which, as Doss argues, “upheld status quo patterns of corporate management and control” <span style="color: red">(Doss 55)</span>. Implicit in Denise Khor’s close reading of several photographs of Chinese railroad laborers is an abstraction of personhood undoubtedly rooted in a racial bias for the White subject: we know who the photographers were, and Khor is able to share plenty of details about their lives, but we do not know the name of a single laborering subject <span style="color: red">(Khor 431)</span>. Finally, TenHoor’s reflection on the architectural diagram draws attention to the ways in which labor is paradoxically lost in the logistical drawing. What is clear is that the corporality of the laboring subject—I use the word “corporality” intentionally, because it suggests both the materiality of a “body” and the metaphysical conditions of “being”—presents a challenge to the ways in which labor can be imaged and imagined in our cultural imaginary. </p>

<p> I find the tension between, on the one hand, Kuskey’s “abstracted” Victorian and Doss’s “beefcake” 1930s American to be profound: reflecting on the norms of visual culture, of course it’s preferable to look at the bare chest of a “well-muscled, sinuous, and virile” worker <span style="color: red">(Doss 64)</span> than the mutilated body of a child. There could be an interesting psychoanalytic interpretation of this phenomenon, but rather than source this predilection in unconscious sexual desire or an Oedipal confusion, Doss’s comments on the muscular figure as lacking any practical utility are revealing: the “ideal” body is little more than a trope of virility mobilized in the service of capital (at a moment, of course, of particular precarity). This brought to mind RS Benedict’s <a href="https://bloodknife.com/everyone-beautiful-no-one-horny/">essay on the aesthetic of Hollywood sex appeal and the militarization of pursuing “hotness”</a>: in both cases, the 1930s “iconography of labor” and contemporary action heroes, the “idealized” form is a sterile icon, a motif of industry and industriousness and decidedly not human processes. </p>


<p> In this light, both Khor and TenHoor’s observations might be somewhat clarified: photographs which contribute the the Chinese Railroad Workers in North America Project seemingly balance, or else foreground, the task of construction and the scale of landscape, folding the laboring subject into a narrative which centers the construction of infrastructure, not those who constructed it. Khor’s comments on Alfred A. Hart’s “Coldstream, Eastern Slope of Western Summit” affords some subjectivity to the worker featured in the image: in capturing a moment of reflection, this photograph is a rare opportunity to see the worker as more than an anonymized laboring body <span style="color: red">(Khor 447-48)</span>. TenHoor’s suggestion that we find new ways to “represent labor in our drawings and models” <span style="color: red">(TenHoor 142)</span> is a response to a similar incommensurability: optimizing and streamlining systems also dispenses with the corporality of the worker’s body (in this way there is an interesting parallel between the aesthetics of the 1930s laborer and the conventions of the logistical drawing). Yet it’s not clear to me exactly how TenHoor envisions this new mode of representation. Could we perhaps say that in calling for recognition of the laboring subject in the architectural practice of diagramming, TenHoor unintentionally furthers this abstracting of the worker’s corporeality? </p>


<p> I want to conclude with what might read as a bit of a non-sequitur: another interesting parallel between these three texts was the personal nature of each piece. Doss had worked at the Wolfsonian, spending time with its collections (and observing the “beefcake” bodies of Miami); Khor was intimately involved in the CRRW archive project and foregrounded her position and experiences; and TenHoor was undoubtedly reflection on her experiences teaching in a school of architect alongside her research findings. On the one hand, these personal connections indicate each author’s subjectivity, and offer a clarifying glimpse into what I might go so far as to call the corporeality of academic “labor.” On the other hand, I think this speaks to the personal fixation and moralizing connotations of labor in American culture that Doss calls out at the outset of her piece: each author cannot separate their own perspectives and personas from the subjects and objects that they examine, and in doings so reminds us that the primacy of labor in shaping “self and civic identity” is certainly still a central feature of American society. </p>
