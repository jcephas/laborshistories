 In my reading response on racialized labor, I discussed the conflation of labor and identity in the national ethos of the United States.  Doss reiterates this point explicitly, and outlines how this conflation has led to multiple masculine identity crises as work either became scarce, moved offshore, or opened to women.  Khor and TenHoor then point out the obvious flaw in this labor–identity conflation: the removal of personhood when one’s labor is not represented.  In the case of Chinese labor to construct the transcontinental railroad, the workers exist only as images in photographs, unnamed.  Furthermore, which photographs they are included in tells more: they are permitted to exist in shows of Arendtian labor (e.g. the constant toils to overcome nature and the manual construction and maintenance of the railroad) but not in shows of Arendtian work (e.g. the spectacular media event imagery of the golden spike that connected the coasts).<sup>1</sup>  While Chinese railroad workers acquired an identity of railroad workers, they lost their own identities, and became a collective without individuals. 
 TenHoor’s discussion of the absence of food workers from the architectural discourse on agricultural and mercantile infrastructure shows how easily masses of people can be forgotten entirely (not just individually) should their labor not find representation in any media— at least the railroad companies took many photos, capturing the existence of the Chinese workers even while forgetting their individual names.  This echoes the sentiments of one of my favorite <i>Log</i> articles: “Outlets” by ‘An Architect’ in <i>Log</i> 51.  Here, the anonymous author equates the photoshop removal of outlets and other minor architectural elements by the firm’s principals to the erasure of the anonymous labor that went into coordination and construction of the ‘pure’ architecture the principal wishes to portray.  Attaining a particular, marketable image requires glossing over the sweat that went into its production.  In that case, this means removing air supply ducts from the photographs; in Khor’s it means taking the photo without the Chinese laborers who built the celebrated object in question, only to have them replaced by their managers and higher-ups.
 Doss identifies that while there is not a definitive overarching propaganda narrative behind American depictions of labor, much of labor’s discourse in the United States has little to do with practical labor matters such as collective organization or mechanical skills.  Instead labor is about the image of labor, and the identity provided in that image.  Slavishak’s discussion of the Pittsburgh workers earlier this semester also highlighted this performance-over-production view of labor.  Doss uses the term “beefcake” repeatedly to refer to historic images of laborers— a word choice that is not meant to be pejorative on her part, but rather one that captures an objectification already present in the American image of labor. 
 <sup>1</sup>There is further murkiness with Arendtian action, specifically when Doss quotes U.S. War Production Board: “Railroads need workers.  Here’s your chance to back up America’s fighting forces.  Get an <i>action job</i> on the railroads which haul to them the things they must have.”  Building railroads are simultaneously labor, work, and action, which begs for further exploration as to how and why they were so thoroughly dismissed in the post-War car-centric America.
